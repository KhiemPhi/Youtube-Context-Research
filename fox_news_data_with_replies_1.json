This can have a significant impact on transmission rates. Reduce the transmission rates to below 1, and the virus recedes, so if masks reduce the spread by only 20% this can be a significant advantage in combating the spread.

These are some of the dumbest statements I've ever heard from anyone... let alone a sitting president. Trump lies about people and events to cover for his own blunders. That is not a good characteristic to have as a public servant as it shows a high level of narcissism. Trump ignored warnings from the CDC and WHO about the incoming pandemic. The CDC and WHO had warnings on their websites for Americans to \"prepare for a severe disruption of everyday life\" due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, Trump was making television appearances claiming the virus is a hoax and no worse than the flu. Because Trump failed to prepare us properly for the pandemic, more innocent Americans lost their lives. When Trump makes a mistake (which is often), Trump doubles down and blames everyone else instead of taking responsibility.", "@Greg Gough ~ I don't see that at all.  I think he has reacted very fast to advice given.  What do you see as \"ignoring advice\"?", "All Trump has done is ignore advice from medical experts during the pandemic... Trump is too dumb to understand what is being discussed in meetings and it causes him to not react appropriately to protect our troops from Russian bounties... Trump is too immature and sets a horrible example for our country... Trump recommended injecting disinfectants and using hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus which was CLEARLY against the advice of medical experts. Trump was a good friend of Epstein and Trump treats women horribly. Over 125,000 people have died because of the Trump virus and his lack of preparation for the pandemic. I could go on and on and on.

My daughter is a hair stylist. When her salon opened back up, she had to go back to work or risk losing her job because she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay the booth rental because she is considered \u201cself-employed\u201d and they turned down her application for unemployment. Since she has a child to support, she went back. She wears a mask all day and sanitizes her chair and other equipment between customers. I guess for some, being able to get their hair done is important during a pandemic. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m thankful in a way, because she needs the money. Most of her customers don\u2019t wear a mask. I don\u2019t know what the answer is for older teachers. I really don\u2019t. Masks, hand washing, and sanitizing? But apparently it\u2019s ok to have elderly grocery store, health care, and other essential workers be exposed daily. It\u2019s important to open bars and theaters, nail and hair salons, beaches and swimming pools, but not schools??  My brother is a teacher and is also high risk. He is adamant that schools need to reopen!  Unless people are staying home all the time and not seeing relatives, etc., they are taking a chance of being exposed. As I have mentioned before, most states have ALREADY opened their economies with recommendations. Recommendations that very few people are following. There are people out there who don\u2019t care if people get exposed. Regardless of what anyone thinks, I\u2019m not one of those. But if they are going to allow thousands to gather and protest/riot across the country and eat inside restaurants and go to movies and go to public pools and gather in large groups, then schools need to open.", "water grove I have no clue what you\u2019re saying.

High risk means I\u2019m of a certain age with age-related health issues.", "Living with Cognitive Dissonance I believe, as other Christians do, that people who continue to sin, do not ask forgiveness for their sins, and don\u2019t invite Jesus into their hearts and believe in Him as the resurrected Son of God and their Lord and Savior,  will be turned away from Heaven when they die. Their name won\u2019t be written in the Book of Life. The ONLY WAY to the Father is through the Son. I don\u2019t claim to know what\u2019s in someone\u2019s heart. Only God knows. However, there are things that the Democratic Party stands for, written in their platform, that ANY Christian would say are sins as they go against God and his teachings in the Bible. I pray NO ONE gets turned away, but everyone has to admit they are sinners and repent!!", "Crlthrn People tend to argue that we (as a country) should take care of/protect those who are in danger of dying from Covid because of their health issues and use that as an excuse to keep from opening the economy. Yes, we should protect them/us. I would never intentionally expose anyone nor would I want anyone, even those who seem to think I\u2019m a selfish, stupid, horrible person, to get sick with Covid. I pray daily for all of us. But I and many others who are high risk are perfectly capable of protecting ourselves. Perhaps my words came out wrong, but my intention was to let people know that as someone who is high risk, I don\u2019t want to be a reason to hold back things that need to happen. I, and others in my situation, can continue to stay home, wear masks, and limit contact. Don\u2019t let US be a reason not to open up. You know, I haven\u2019t gotten on here being ugly to anyone and I\u2019m getting very frustrated at people questioning my heart. I know I have a good heart and mean the very best. Anyone who knows me will tell you the same. My faith is solid. I\u2019ve been told by a preacher\u2019s wife that I had the faith of a child and that was rare (which is a tremendous compliment)! Am I perfect? Of course not! You seem intent on taking what people say out of context and questioning their Christianity. ONLY GOD KNOWS WHAT IS IN A PERSON\u2019S HEART, and I\u2019m not afraid for Him to see mine! I\u2019ve simply tried to show that everyone who can should take responsibility for themselves. If someone can\u2019t, then yes, others need to help make sure they are protected. But apparently I\u2019m not even allowed to say that I can take steps myself to help reduce MY risk (as can most people) without being called names. I\u2019m sure many people in my situation feel the same way. I don\u2019t know why I even bother trying to explain.

Just because things open back up, that doesn\u2019t mean people with health issues or people who are worried about contracting the virus HAVE to get out and expose themselves. Parents don\u2019t HAVE to send their kids to school. Many schools are giving options of online or in person. Ours and surrounding public school systems are. Or parents always have the option of homeschooling. We have been for years with one grandchild (who has learning and health issues), yet 12 others attend public school or daycare. Their parents all agree this needs to happen. The point is, they have ALREADY opened up the economy up in most areas...including things like bars and movie theaters. They are allowing for massive protest/riot gatherings that governors and mayors not only allow, but actively participate in (the mayor of Atlanta attended a protest and took her mask off, she and her husband recently tested positive for Covid), people are having large gatherings with no regard to recommended safety guidelines. There was one of over 100 young people near us recently (where multiple people were shot), in one state, college students threw a huge \u201cCovid Party\u201d and everyone put money in a pot. The first one diagnosed with Covid gets the money. A local large shopping complex stays packed. From observing, I estimated only 5-10% of the people going to shop for clothes, etc., are wearing masks and social distancing. The beaches are packed. People act like things are normal. Those are the ones who have no regard for others. It doesn\u2019t make sense to continue to allow these to open/occur, yet stop children from attending school. I am in no way trying to be selfish or mean or uncaring...but I am realistic. I was initially against opening things up because I knew what was going to happen, but we can\u2019t stay \u201cquarantined\u201d in our homes forever and Covid will still be there when they do open, so it makes no difference. They have already admitted it might be years before a safe vaccine is ready. We can\u2019t keep printing money and spending money to pay people to sit home. If our economy continues to decline and unemployment rates continue to climb, people will start getting desperate. Crime has already increased exponentially and even a Democratic senator suggested it was due to unemployment and hunger (and of course defunding the police).

He has an opposing party that controls the press, Hollywood, and billionaires like Gates and Bezos. Whatever move he makes, they find a way to condemn. Meanwhile Democrat mayors and governors as well as Democrat congressional politicians encourage these disruptive actions. I think Trump's decision to offer help, but let them deal with it and the consequences on their own is a shrewd move on his part. I watched the Mount Rushmore celebration and his speech on July 3rd.

The system you'd use to submit homework, is NOT a full online course system. \n\nThe problem I have with your entire argument, is that from and IT standpoint, you're still wrong. The only instance in which are you correct is if the school just redirects to an online institutions schooling system, and uses their coursework as well.\n\nThat's why I asked you what you believed technologically went into the process.

The Republicans, Trump, Betsy DeVos; eliminate them from your mind as we are not discussing them right now. We never were or at least I was not. I'm going to explain this for the last time. Even if we have to lay down additional cable and add another subscription to a third-party education platform it would still be cheaper than operating a traditional School. Cable and data are cheaper than fuel, food and a plethora of other things we would no longer have to spend money on. There is no counter-argument to this. There are no metrics that will support your claim that it is not. It is, quite literally, simple math.

I mean from an actual technical standpoint how do they work? Do you think it's just some regular computer running a cheap piece of software for the website or something?", "@YummyBubbles I think you're being facetiously ignorant so you don't have to acknowledge my points. Everyone knows that some schools, especially colleges and universities, charge more for online courses because of convenience. Its why things are more expensive at a convenience store. You're paying for the option of efficiency and speed. In reality, online is way cheaper than the operation of a traditional school. One does not need to learn this anywhere as it is a simple observation any layman can come to and understand. The only things taxes would have to go to in an online school setting would be the salary and internet access of the teacher, online interfaces for low income families and the laying of cable in areas that do not have online infrastructure. That's it. All you have to do to see my point is compare that to the things we would no longer have to supply to a traditional School and multiply it by the number of traditional schools we have. You see now, yes?", "@Cannabis Calm I haven't deleted anything. Although, instead of arguing logic, I'll just ask two simple questions:\n1) Where you learn that online was so much cheaper than in school that the school could survive without funding?\n\n2) How well do you truly believe that the solution the tiny school in the tiny town you live in actually works on a larger scale?\n\nI'd bet for such a small school, to offer online classes they're probably paying to use another platforms services, rather than implement their own.

It happens). I live in a town of 8000 and our backwoods school still has online classes. The majority of schools do have online infrastructure. Even if they did not we would still be getting a refund because the cost of implementing such infrastructure is lower than the cost of operating an actual school in a building.

The Republican party is an example. It has been fragmented by impeached Trump and his white nationalist followers, some of who DO promote fascism (neo-Nazism).\n\nTrumplicans are seen as \"fascist\" because it is the most expedient term to describe their illegal, cruel, and authoritarian style. This is a term used to make a comparison to the political norms in America rather than a claim of a political overthrow of Democracy. Although, as previously said, some American fascist groups claim Trump as THEIR president and the only one furthering their agenda. By comparison, there are no self-proclaimed American Marxist groups claiming Democrats, nor Biden, as representing their cause.\n\n\"The rule of law\" is a tool of fascists, and the call for its enforcement with extreme prejudice by the military against protestors is one of the more recent examples of why Trumplicans have a fascist reputation. There has been no abandonment of law and order, as you have suggested. That is just another chicken-little fear-mongering tactic by ignorant Trumplicans to warrant their irrational call to use the military. We now see that the civil unrest has died down, moderation seems to have worked even if it was not the \"stomping out\" of the protesters that Trumplicans desired. It just goes to show that fascist tactics do not have traction in America, nor does the mob win the day.\n\nI understand your fears, but i do not share them.

The Constitutional conservatives and real \"rule of law\" Republicans no longer see a place for them in the Trumplican party. The REAL Christians who were not willing to abandon their morals to support Trump are unable to support the Trumplican party. The Evangelicals (faux Christians) abandoned their piety quickly because they felt Trump would lead them to victory on their immoral cause, and now REAL Christians do not want that association. So, now Trumplicans have no way to reunite their broken Republican base and are fearful of their political future. There only hope is to demonizing the Democratic party that is poised to defeat them resoundingly in November.

It is entirely inaccurate. It's the governors of each state that determine what action their state will take to address the covid-19 threat.

That's why New York has had far more covid-19 deaths than any other state--over four times as many as the next state.\nCuomo used executive orders to force nursing homes to accept those who had tested positive for covid-19. (Brilliant!) New York's subway system was never closed--an ideal environment for the virus and its spread. Yet it was two months before the effort to sanitize the system began.  In 2015, the New York Board of Health recommended that medical equipment be obtained to deal with a possible pandemic. Cuomo ignored that recommendation and instead wasted $1.5 billion tax payer dollars on a solar panel company that failed, a computer chip company that failed and a light bulb manufacturing company that failed.\nNew York was one of the states, all led by democrat governors, that allowed thousands of protesters aka rioters to saturate the streets. No effort was made to get them to wear masks, practice social distancing or rein in their destructive actions.\nDemocrats continue their disingenuous practices. They are determined to do all they can to prevent schools from opening despite studies in Iceland, Ireland and the Netherlands confirming it does not increase the chances of getting covid-19. As for the number of cases of covid-19 in the US, we are far from the top when population is factored in. A lot more people in the US have died with covid-19 than from covid-19.

I am not a babysitter, my job is to teach kids, keep them safe, and I would love more then anything to go back, I miss my kids. I miss my classroom and my students and normal life. Online learning is 10000x harder than regular classroom life, and I hate the idea of going back online, but I have a family too. 3/3 teachers FOLLOWING CDC guidelines GOT Covid at summerschool and one DIED. Jobs where you can work from home in a safer way should stay at home. Even if only a few kids spread and contract Covid the risk is too high to kids and their families, it is NOT worth it. There is research saying up to 13,000 kids could contract it if we are going back too soon. If the research is NOT conclusive one way or the other I'd rather be safe than sorry when it comes to CHILDREN'S LIVES. Most of the data about kids not getting Covid is coming from a time where kids were NOT seeing each other and NOT in school so the data isn't looking at when kids are squished in tiny classrooms. I'd like to see people try to keep my 5 and 6 year olds 6 feet apart and keep a mask on. Last year alone 2 kids sneezed in my FACE. I watch kids at the grocery store pull their masks off to sneeze or cough... FUND US... GIVE US THE RESOURCES to open safely... but nobody is offering this. They are saying \"Just open up!\" Without giving us extra funding, or the resources needed to do it safely. Look at other countries that are opening up schools, they are putting money into making it safer to open with kids and they WAITED til their numbers were 0 or close to 0 new cases in those areas. WHY would we go back when almost EVERYWHERE in America the numbers are climbing. It isn't safe. Teachers, custodians, administrators, counselors lives matter.

I already pay ridiculous money for my local schools.

If the risk outweighs the benefits, families should opt out. I worked in a hospital for 10 years. I was hospitalized myself for almost a month at a specialty for a high risk pregnancy. I saw the bills. I'm the breadwinner, and I know it is scary being unable to work due to a health issue that was life threatening. Masking under normal circumstances prevents viral shedding to others (not as effective during vigorous physical activity, coughing and sneezing). Healthy families should be allowed to make their educational decisions themselves. We should not be infantilized by mini dictators. \n\nIn Oregon we spend $15k per year per student for a lousy educational product. School choice would promote competition so if schools wanted the money, they'd have to compete for students. Made a huge difference in Sweden. All schools became more responsible. Monopolies never need to provide good service. Look at the DMV.", "@cowsal77 think of it this way if someone who's working paycheck to paycheck at the school, or if a poor kid takes the virus home where either they or one of there family members has to be hospitalized.

Probability is very high that there will be a vaccine according to basically every expert in the field. And if one never comes to be, we can deal with that then. But giving up 4 months in is basically the stupidest option on the table.", "@Kristopher Thompson we don't have vaccines for all viruses, not even close. I hope one is developed and reasonably safe, but it's an act of faith to depend on a vaccine. We don't have one for HIV, herpes, Hep C, the common cold which is a type of coronavirus, etc.", "@cowsal77 also, there will be a vaccine. There's nothing special about Covid that will prevent a vaccine from being made. It's a virus like any other virus.", "@cowsal77 you basically agreed with me.

They're not taking steps to ensure low risk people only attend, they're telling schools to open or lose out on funding.", "@Kristopher Thompson what if we never develop a vaccine? Low risk faculty can choose to work. Low risk students should go back. I'm against mandated, nationalized curriculum personally. Our local school is trash. In Sweden they allow school choice, and it works well. Here our public schools create a caste system. Many teach opinions, not facts. I don't need/want my kids to know the right opinions. I want them to discern truth when provided with data/studies/details. They should be skeptical, curious and logical, not brainwashed sloganeers. We know this disease is less dangerous in different demographics which is why the solution for different age groups should be different.", "@cowsal77 issue is the parents aren't making a choice for \"their family\" they're making a choice for everyone they come in contact with. School Faculty, grocery store staff, delivery drivers, the person who touches a product after they touch it, medical staff, etc. If people practiced proper social distancing, always wore masks when in public, and kept their hands to themselves, then maybe. But they don't, obviously. If anything, delay the school year and make up missed time later if people are absolutely against online school.", "@Kristopher Thompson I work with high risk population. Most of us have families. We mask and reduce entry to this facility. Parents should have the choice if their family is too high risk to send kids back. Daycare has stayed open.

There is a lot of paperwork, #'s & such we submit daily in our medical setting that is solely used & transmitted to the state, Fed Gov't, and down the line thru CDC, WHO, etc. It's pretty cumbersome yet fool-proof because you will get errors if anything little thing doesn't appear to be in line. Even that has evolved into some indepth figures needed over the course of a few months. All kinds of data can be extracted to now show the spread & helping with tracing on down to medical supplies used & available. It's impressive no doubt.

Due to social-distancing requirements, those surveyed agreed that there should be limits on class size when Trump returns to school, but that his class should be large enough to accommodate other education-starved students such as Jared Kushner, Rand Paul, and Betsy DeVos. \n \nAlthough Americans acknowledge that the logistics of sending Trump back to school could be complicated and expensive, the cost of his continuing lack of education is far greater, the poll indicates.  Americans were split on which school subjects they would like to see Trump focus on most when he returns to the classroom.  Science and math received the strongest support, but a substantial number of respondents also favored history, geography, and English.

(The Borowitz Report)\u2014Amid the debate over reopening the nation\u2019s schools, a new poll shows that an overwhelming majority of Americans would like Donald J. Trump to go back to school in the fall.  Due to social-distancing requirements, those surveyed agreed that there should be limits on class size when Trump returns to school, but that his class should be large enough to accommodate other education-starved students such as Jared Kushner, Rand Paul, and Betsy DeVos. \n \nAlthough Americans acknowledge that the logistics of sending Trump back to school could be complicated and expensive, the cost of his continuing lack of education is far greater, the poll indicates.  Americans were split on which school subjects they would like to see Trump focus on most when he returns to the classroom.  Science and math received the strongest support, but a substantial number of respondents also favored history, geography, and English.  Finally, if Trump is ordered back to school in the fall, a vast majority of respondents urged that steps be taken to insure that he does not send someone else in his place.": [], "Ok Dems, NOW WHAT?!?!": [], "Thank God, finally someone talking truth!!!

I bring up other countries only to show how others have more successfully dealt with certain social issues. I understand that their history and culture and implementation varies from the US, but I point to them as examples of of where it works (imperfectly of course, but where there is a better quality of life for more of their citizens as a result). While I have no doubt that there are people who take advantage of social programs, they cost the US a fraction of the cost of rich people and corporations taking advantage of tax loop holes, bail outs, or regulations.

You seem like a thoughtful person, so I'm certain you're beyond the 'poor people are just lazy' argument, but that you don't see social programs as helping them move beyond dependency. The question I start with is \"Why are people poor?\"\n\n...I'm not an expert, but here's just one example: I can see that the minimum wage is so low here that when faced with the choice of working two jobs to feed my kids and pay for child care, or accepting government money to stay home and take care of my own kids, what do you think I'm doing to do? The solution to this seems to be to increase the minimum wage. Although this might affect the bottom line of corporations (and I'm not ignoring the impact on small businesses either) but eventually if raised over the course of a few years, we will adjust. \n\nMaybe people are poor because of mental health issues, or addictions. If that is the case, giving them blank checks isn't really helping them either. So maybe the solution is investing that money into better health programs. \n\nRecognizing that we also have an economic system that relies on having a certain percentage of the population unemployed, is also important. If unemployment gets too low, we have inflation issues so we will never have 0% unemployment. Knowing that, what should we do with these people? \n\nI have a lot more questions than answers, and I'm glad you're willing to talk with me about this. I think there are lot intelligent people working on these issues, and many solutions out there. I also think there are many people who benefit from you believing that poor people are the problem, and if we just stopped supporting them your life would be better.

I have never really been involved in politics and didn\u2019t take the time to educate myself on important issues. For a long time, I have voted straight democrat because I just didn\u2019t pay attention.

After watching the evening news and only hearing about Covid and deaths and doom and gloom and absolutely nothing else, I grew depressed, but also suspicious. I started researching and came across a couple of videos posted by the two doctors from Bakersfield who had a different take on the virus. A lot of it made sense to me but then their videos disappeared. I didn\u2019t even know at the time that social media was actually in the business of censorship. I said something to a coworker and she suggested a YouTube channel to watch regarding Trump and the Patriots taking down the Deep State. This led me to discovering more channels with people who were once on the Left and are now on the Right. People just like me! I then found myself watching Fox news for the first time. I can\u2019t even believe I have made a complete 180 and will now be voting for Trump in November. I used to hate Trump and when he won the election, I thought the world was going to end. Now I see that the media has been lying to us. I was so uniformed and asleep. 95% of my friends and all of my family are on the Left. I see their posts and their hatred. I have to keep reminding myself that I was once like them, believing all the lies. I am now seeing how mainstream media says nothing good about Trump and only reports bad things about him and twists the truth. I am now seeing how much good he is doing and how much he loves this country.

Here's a quick explanation:\n\nAir has to pass through the mask so you can breath which means there's a limit to how small of particles the mask can stop. N95 masks are very good and stop down to 3 microns. Unfortunately viruses and covid19 in particular are many times smaller. The reason they are effective at slowing the slread from a sick person despite the virus being so small is due to the virus being most concentrated in large water droplets when you cough. Individual viruses could pass through, but not millions at once.\n\nTake a person without symptoms. The virus will pass straight through the mask as they breath just like it will in the symptomatic person. However there are droplets of millions of viruses that are being coughed up, so mask is more or less doing nothing but making it hard to breath.", "@David Cooper People can be asymptomatic, unaware they have Covid -19  yet still spread the virus.

A subset of studies and data shared by some countries on detailed cluster investigations and contact tracing activities have reported that asymptomatically-infected individuals are much less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms.\n\nComprehensive studies on transmission from asymptomatic patients are difficult to conduct, as they require testing of large population cohorts and more data are needed to better understand and quantified the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. WHO is working with countries around the world, and global researchers, to gain better evidence-based understanding of the disease as a whole, including the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of the virus.\"\n\nThe phrase \"very rare\" is never used in this W.H.O. statement on asymptomatic transmission.", "@Ehwaz you never met my ex girlfriend.", "@William Joyner He's just a twat with no friends and a shitty youtube channel where he says his ex girlfriend and 5g towers are scarier than Covid.
