And if it is accurate, then I think we must question the logic of shutting down the economy.  Please read and see if it rings true to you. Thanks\nThe following is from a medical forum. The writer prefers to stay anonymous, because presenting any narrative different than the official one can cause you a lot of stress and put your career and profession at stake.\n\n\u201cI work in the healthcare field. Here's the problem, we are testing people for any strain of a Coronavirus\u2014not specifically for COVID-19. There are no reliable tests for a specific COVID-19 virus. There are no reliable agencies or media outlets for reporting numbers of actual COVID-19 virus cases. This needs to be addressed first and foremost. \n\n \n\nEvery action and reaction to COVID-19 is based on totally flawed data and we simply cannot make accurate assessments. This is the reason why you're hearing that most people with COVID-19 are showing nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. That's because most Coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. The few actual novel Coronavirus cases do have some worse respiratory responses, but still have a very promising recovery rate, especially for those without prior issues.\n\n\n\n The \u2018gold standard\u2019 in testing for COVID-19 is laboratory isolated/purified coronavirus particles free from any contaminants and particles that look like viruses but are not, that have been proven to be the cause of the syndrome known as COVID-19 and obtained by using proper viral isolation methods and controls (not the PCR that is currently being used or Serology /antibody tests which do not detect virus as such). PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for \u2018viral sequences\u2019, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome.\n\n\n\nThe problem is the test is known not to work because it uses \u2018amplification\u2019 which means taking a very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analyzed. Obviously, any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery.\n\n Additionally, it\u2019s only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues.\n\n\n\nThe Mickey Mouse test kits being sent out to hospitals, at best, tell analysts you have some viral DNA in your cells. Which most of us do, most of the time. It may tell you the viral sequence is related to a specific type of virus \u2013 say the huge family of coronavirus. But that\u2019s all. \n\n\n\n The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even getting into the other issue \u2013 viral load. If you remember the PCR works by amplifying minute amounts of DNA. It therefore is useless at telling you how much virus you may have. And that\u2019s the only question that really matters when it comes to diagnosing illness. Everyone will have a few viruses kicking round in their system at any time, and most will not cause illness because their quantities are too small. For a virus to sicken you you, need a lot of it, a massive amount of it. But PCR does not test viral load and therefore can\u2019t determine if a osteogenesis is present in sufficient quantities to sicken you.\n\n\n\nIf you feel sick and get a PCR test any random virus DNA might be identified even if they aren\u2019t at all involved in your sickness which leads to false diagnosis. And coronavirus are incredibly common. A large percentage of the world human population will have covi DNA in them in small quantities even if they are perfectly well or sick with some other pathogen.\n\n\n\nDo you see where this is going yet? If you want to create a totally false panic about a totally false pandemic \u2013 pick a coronavirus. They are incredibly common and there\u2019s tons of them. A very high percentage of people who have become sick by other means (flu, bacterial pneumonia, anything) will have a positive PCR test for covi even if you\u2019re doing them properly and ruling out contamination, simply because covis are so common.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of flu and pneumonia victims in hospitals throughout the world at any one time.  All you need to do is select the sickest of these in a single location \u2013 say Wuhan \u2013 administer PCR tests to them and claim anyone showing viral sequences similar to a coronavirus (which will inevitably be quite a few) is suffering from a \u2018new\u2019 disease.\n\n\n\nSince you already selected the sickest flu cases a fairly high proportion of your sample will go on to die. You can then say this \u2018new\u2019 virus has a CFR higher than the flu and use this to infuse more concern and do more tests which will of course produce more \u2018cases\u2019, which expands the testing, which produces yet more \u2018cases\u2019 and so on and so on.\n\n\n\nBefore long you have your \u2018pandemic\u2019, and all you have done is use a simple test kit trick to convert the worst flu and pneumonia cases into something new that doesn\u2019t actually exist. Now just run the same scam in other countries. Making sure to keep the fear message running high so that people will feel panicky and less able to think critically.\n\n\n\nYour only problem is going to be that \u2013 due to the fact there is no actual new deadly pathogen but just regular sick people, you are mislabeling your case numbers, and especially your deaths, are going to be way too low for a real new deadly virus pandemic. But you can stop people pointing this out in several ways.\n\n\n\n1. You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are imminent. Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and then claim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.\n\n\n\n2. You can tell people that \u2018minimizing\u2019 the dangers is irresponsible and bully them into not talking about numbers.\n\n\n\n3. You can talk crap about made up numbers hoping to blind people with pseudoscience.\n\n\n\n 4. You can start testing well people (who, of course, will also likely have shreds of coronavirus DNA in them) and thus inflate your \u2018case figures\u2019 with \u2018asymptomatic carriers\u2019 (you will of course have to spin that to sound deadly even though any virologist knows the more symptom-less cases you have the less deadly is your pathogen.\n\n \n\nTake these 4 simple steps and you can have your own entirely manufactured pandemic up and running in weeks.\n\n\n\nRemember this: They cannot \"confirm\" something for which there is no accurate test.\u201d", "We need to commit ourselves to this concept regarding overreacting and political theater:\n\n\"NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN!\"", "There's a song by the music group Ministry: \"Fear Is Big Business\".

Since the particulates of Covid 19 are in the 100 microns, (which is much smaller in size)these particulates will simply travel through the 300 micron mesh filters of the mask exposing the person to Covid 19, and providing a false sense of protection.

And if it is accurate, then I think we must question the logic of shutting down the economy.  Please read and see if it rings true to you. Thanks\nThe following is from a medical forum. The writer prefers to stay anonymous, because presenting any narrative different than the official one can cause you a lot of stress and put your career and profession at stake.\n\n\u201cI work in the healthcare field. Here's the problem, we are testing people for any strain of a Coronavirus\u2014not specifically for COVID-19. There are no reliable tests for a specific COVID-19 virus. There are no reliable agencies or media outlets for reporting numbers of actual COVID-19 virus cases. This needs to be addressed first and foremost. \n\n \n\nEvery action and reaction to COVID-19 is based on totally flawed data and we simply cannot make accurate assessments. This is the reason why you're hearing that most people with COVID-19 are showing nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. That's because most Coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. The few actual novel Coronavirus cases do have some worse respiratory responses, but still have a very promising recovery rate, especially for those without prior issues.\n\n\n\n The \u2018gold standard\u2019 in testing for COVID-19 is laboratory isolated/purified coronavirus particles free from any contaminants and particles that look like viruses but are not, that have been proven to be the cause of the syndrome known as COVID-19 and obtained by using proper viral isolation methods and controls (not the PCR that is currently being used or Serology /antibody tests which do not detect virus as such). PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for \u2018viral sequences\u2019, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome.\n\n\n\nThe problem is the test is known not to work because it uses \u2018amplification\u2019 which means taking a very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analyzed. Obviously, any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery.\n\n Additionally, it\u2019s only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues.\n\n\n\nThe Mickey Mouse test kits being sent out to hospitals, at best, tell analysts you have some viral DNA in your cells. Which most of us do, most of the time. It may tell you the viral sequence is related to a specific type of virus \u2013 say the huge family of coronavirus. But that\u2019s all. \n\n\n\n The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even getting into the other issue \u2013 viral load. If you remember the PCR works by amplifying minute amounts of DNA. It therefore is useless at telling you how much virus you may have. And that\u2019s the only question that really matters when it comes to diagnosing illness. Everyone will have a few viruses kicking round in their system at any time, and most will not cause illness because their quantities are too small. For a virus to sicken you you, need a lot of it, a massive amount of it. But PCR does not test viral load and therefore can\u2019t determine if a osteogenesis is present in sufficient quantities to sicken you.\n\n\n\nIf you feel sick and get a PCR test any random virus DNA might be identified even if they aren\u2019t at all involved in your sickness which leads to false diagnosis. And coronavirus are incredibly common. A large percentage of the world human population will have covi DNA in them in small quantities even if they are perfectly well or sick with some other pathogen.\n\n\n\nDo you see where this is going yet? If you want to create a totally false panic about a totally false pandemic \u2013 pick a coronavirus. They are incredibly common and there\u2019s tons of them. A very high percentage of people who have become sick by other means (flu, bacterial pneumonia, anything) will have a positive PCR test for covi even if you\u2019re doing them properly and ruling out contamination, simply because covis are so common.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of flu and pneumonia victims in hospitals throughout the world at any one time.  All you need to do is select the sickest of these in a single location \u2013 say Wuhan \u2013 administer PCR tests to them and claim anyone showing viral sequences similar to a coronavirus (which will inevitably be quite a few) is suffering from a \u2018new\u2019 disease.\n\n\n\nSince you already selected the sickest flu cases a fairly high proportion of your sample will go on to die. You can then say this \u2018new\u2019 virus has a CFR higher than the flu and use this to infuse more concern and do more tests which will of course produce more \u2018cases\u2019, which expands the testing, which produces yet more \u2018cases\u2019 and so on and so on.\n\n\n\nBefore long you have your \u2018pandemic\u2019, and all you have done is use a simple test kit trick to convert the worst flu and pneumonia cases into something new that doesn\u2019t actually exist. Now just run the same scam in other countries. Making sure to keep the fear message running high so that people will feel panicky and less able to think critically.\n\n\n\nYour only problem is going to be that \u2013 due to the fact there is no actual new deadly pathogen but just regular sick people, you are mislabeling your case numbers, and especially your deaths, are going to be way too low for a real new deadly virus pandemic. But you can stop people pointing this out in several ways.\n\n\n\n1. You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are imminent. Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and then claim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.\n\n\n\n2. You can tell people that \u2018minimizing\u2019 the dangers is irresponsible and bully them into not talking about numbers.\n\n\n\n3. You can talk crap about made up numbers hoping to blind people with pseudoscience.\n\n\n\n 4. You can start testing well people (who, of course, will also likely have shreds of coronavirus DNA in them) and thus inflate your \u2018case figures\u2019 with \u2018asymptomatic carriers\u2019 (you will of course have to spin that to sound deadly even though any virologist knows the more symptom-less cases you have the less deadly is your pathogen.\n\n \n\nTake these 4 simple steps and you can have your own entirely manufactured pandemic up and running in weeks.\n\n\n\nRemember this: They cannot \"confirm\" something for which there is no accurate test.\u201d": ["Diane McDermott Very interesting", "Diane McDermott I think there is some really interesting detail in this.", "Diane McDermott I think there is some really interesting detail in this."], "We need to commit ourselves to this concept regarding overreacting and political theater:\n\n\"NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN!\"": ["screwanimalabusers not mother nature but big brother globalist agenda 21 virus is a fraud but the Marshall Law is real", "History tells us it will happen again and again and again.", "this is mother natures way of giving us a warning, the next one could be the big one"], "There's a song by the music group Ministry: \"Fear Is Big Business\".

Mark Twain": ["Brooke Hunter Note: I voted for Jimmy Carter; I hope that doesn\u2019t shatter your stereotype of Christians overly. I have never in my life heard a Christian refer to him/herself as \u201cevangelical\u201c. While you say I wildly missed the mark by assuming you are a Leftist you have neither denied being such nor defined what you are. Clues that would lead me to that are such things as making up bogus quotes and attributing them anonymously by using the word \u201csupposedly\u201d, referencing the flag and the Bible as mere camouflage (would this perhaps be your own motive?) and making reference to \u201cspirit animals\u201d; this is rhetoric not normally associated with people on the Right. Your use of the terms \u201csoul\u201c and \u201cselling one soul\u201d is the sort of moral preening Leftists resort to. But feel free to define what you are. It is illuminating to know that your bigotry coincides with Mr. Goldwater\u2019s. I know now why no one has answered my question \u201chow do you define evangelical?\u201c You have no real definition other than a raised eyebrow, eye-rolling \u201cyou know, those _religious_ types\u201d \u2013 otherwise translated as \u201cpeople I don\u2019t like.\u201d With your mask removed there is hate underneath; message received. \n\u201cHow could a Christian so debase their beliefs as to support Donald Trump.\u201d \nYou are either a Leftist or a Never-Trumper lacking the courage to disclose yourself as such. Contrary to what you evidently think Christians - or \u201cevangelicals\u201c (if I can type that without laughing) do not live in the ideological enclaves and political desert islands the Left inhabit. Christianity was born of Judaism in the crucible of the Roman empire amidst monotheism, pantheism, animism, agnosticism atheism; every kind of belief and non-belief. One of the basic tenants of the United States is religious freedom. That includes the right to not believe, otherwise belief is compulsory and there is no freedom of religiono. The Left, in their ideological isolation, live primarily with people who look like themselves, dress, act, walk, talk and think like themselves. As a result you think you are the norm and anything different from you is an aberration. We in middle America, the working class, work side-by-side with Baptist and Buddhists, atheists and Rastafarians. We do not have the intolerance that exists among urban Leftists. When a plumber or electrician comes to my door to fix the pipes or the wiring I don\u2019t demand he put his hand on a Bible and swear eternal loyalty to Jesus Christ, I show him where the pipes and the wires are. I have not required a purity test of the employees at the stores I frequent. And as regards Trump: the Left informed us in no uncertain terms long ago that they do not share our sense of morality and have spared no opportunity to remind us of that. We get it; folks in the big city don\u2019t roll the way we do. And Trump rolled the way they do in the big city. The Left had no problem with Trump\u2019s lifestyle when he was a liberal Democrat. Boys will be boys and billionaires will be playboys, ha ha! But when he declared himself to be a Republican and a champion in the working class, liberal Democrats suddenly sprouted wings, put on choir robes and halos and pointed fingers of righteous wrath at Trump, stared at us with flaming eyes and condemned us for any association with Trump. It has afforded me no end of amusement at this towering hypocrisy. How can we endure Trump? Because we endure the way the Left, liberal Democrats and liberal Republicans live, we don\u2019t become hysterical like you people do, who hold themselves to one standard and everyone else to another. Christians don\u2019t do that, we accept people as they are, work with them as fellow human beings, hope and pray the best for them. It is your own intolerance that makes you incapable of understanding this. It leads you to say things like \u201chow can Christians debase their beliefs\u201d \u2013 how is understanding someone where they are debasing anyone?  You are what you conceive us to be: inflexible, unforgiving and uncharitable \u2013 and if we are tolerant of those who are different from us then we have \u201cdebased\u201c ourselves. We hired Trump to do a job like hiring a plumber or an electrician, he is doing it. I now return you to your self-righteous rant.", "Big Dog \nLove your compassion \nfor the victims.\nTake care", "Dennis Vance     Sorry to not be immediately available tp respond to your pressing inquiry, even if it widely missed the mark by assuming that I am a leftist. Evangelical used to be used in purely a religious sense.  It now refers as much to a political as a theological, movement.  I remember getting Barry Goldwater\u2019s,  \u201cMr. Conservative\u201d, autograph during his run as the Republican candidate in 1964. I think that\u2019s when I first became aware of the political implications of the religious becoming active in politics. He said then\n\n\u201cMark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damm problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise.

Even though I supported Reagan, it was disquieting to watch the politically motivated southern evangelicals shun the very Christian, evangelical, Jimmy Carter purely for political expediency.  Those now called evangelical,  almost all of whom now are white, may not attend church often or at all, and they may not be interested in, or even aware of, the beliefs that have typically characterized evangelical Christians. This ultimately has lead to today, where a group that prided themselves on living a life based on Christian values, have sold their souls, again for political expedience, to support the least Christian President in memory. You say that you can\u2019t get an answer to \u201cwhat is an evangelical\u201d. My repeatedly unanswered question is \u201cHow could a Christian so debase their beliefs to support President Trump\u201d.\n\nAsk a Trump Republican ( an opportunist populist, to be distinguished from a conservative Republican who believes in both aspects of the first amendment, free markets, diminishing the deficit and budget, restrained use of tariffs, and as Reagan put it \u201ccharacter matters\u201d) a question that demands a factual, honest answer, and you get a character assassination instead of a reasoned response.

And if it is accurate, then I think we must question the logic of shutting down the economy.  Please read and see if it rings true to you. Thanks\nThe following is from a medical forum. The writer prefers to stay anonymous, because presenting any narrative different than the official one can cause you a lot of stress and put your career and profession at stake.\n\n\u201cI work in the healthcare field. Here's the problem, we are testing people for any strain of a Coronavirus\u2014not specifically for COVID-19. There are no reliable tests for a specific COVID-19 virus. There are no reliable agencies or media outlets for reporting numbers of actual COVID-19 virus cases. This needs to be addressed first and foremost. \n\n \n\nEvery action and reaction to COVID-19 is based on totally flawed data and we simply cannot make accurate assessments. This is the reason why you're hearing that most people with COVID-19 are showing nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. That's because most Coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. The few actual novel Coronavirus cases do have some worse respiratory responses, but still have a very promising recovery rate, especially for those without prior issues.\n\n\n\n The \u2018gold standard\u2019 in testing for COVID-19 is laboratory isolated/purified coronavirus particles free from any contaminants and particles that look like viruses but are not, that have been proven to be the cause of the syndrome known as COVID-19 and obtained by using proper viral isolation methods and controls (not the PCR that is currently being used or Serology /antibody tests which do not detect virus as such). PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for \u2018viral sequences\u2019, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome.\n\n\n\nThe problem is the test is known not to work because it uses \u2018amplification\u2019 which means taking a very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analyzed. Obviously, any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery.\n\n Additionally, it\u2019s only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues.\n\n\n\nThe Mickey Mouse test kits being sent out to hospitals, at best, tell analysts you have some viral DNA in your cells. Which most of us do, most of the time. It may tell you the viral sequence is related to a specific type of virus \u2013 say the huge family of coronavirus. But that\u2019s all. \n\n\n\n The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even getting into the other issue \u2013 viral load. If you remember the PCR works by amplifying minute amounts of DNA. It therefore is useless at telling you how much virus you may have. And that\u2019s the only question that really matters when it comes to diagnosing illness. Everyone will have a few viruses kicking round in their system at any time, and most will not cause illness because their quantities are too small. For a virus to sicken you you, need a lot of it, a massive amount of it. But PCR does not test viral load and therefore can\u2019t determine if a osteogenesis is present in sufficient quantities to sicken you.\n\n\n\nIf you feel sick and get a PCR test any random virus DNA might be identified even if they aren\u2019t at all involved in your sickness which leads to false diagnosis. And coronavirus are incredibly common. A large percentage of the world human population will have covi DNA in them in small quantities even if they are perfectly well or sick with some other pathogen.\n\n\n\nDo you see where this is going yet? If you want to create a totally false panic about a totally false pandemic \u2013 pick a coronavirus. They are incredibly common and there\u2019s tons of them. A very high percentage of people who have become sick by other means (flu, bacterial pneumonia, anything) will have a positive PCR test for covi even if you\u2019re doing them properly and ruling out contamination, simply because covis are so common.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of flu and pneumonia victims in hospitals throughout the world at any one time.  All you need to do is select the sickest of these in a single location \u2013 say Wuhan \u2013 administer PCR tests to them and claim anyone showing viral sequences similar to a coronavirus (which will inevitably be quite a few) is suffering from a \u2018new\u2019 disease.\n\n\n\nSince you already selected the sickest flu cases a fairly high proportion of your sample will go on to die. You can then say this \u2018new\u2019 virus has a CFR higher than the flu and use this to infuse more concern and do more tests which will of course produce more \u2018cases\u2019, which expands the testing, which produces yet more \u2018cases\u2019 and so on and so on.\n\n\n\nBefore long you have your \u2018pandemic\u2019, and all you have done is use a simple test kit trick to convert the worst flu and pneumonia cases into something new that doesn\u2019t actually exist. Now just run the same scam in other countries. Making sure to keep the fear message running high so that people will feel panicky and less able to think critically.\n\n\n\nYour only problem is going to be that \u2013 due to the fact there is no actual new deadly pathogen but just regular sick people, you are mislabeling your case numbers, and especially your deaths, are going to be way too low for a real new deadly virus pandemic. But you can stop people pointing this out in several ways.\n\n\n\n1. You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are imminent. Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and then claim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.\n\n\n\n2. You can tell people that \u2018minimizing\u2019 the dangers is irresponsible and bully them into not talking about numbers.\n\n\n\n3. You can talk crap about made up numbers hoping to blind people with pseudoscience.\n\n\n\n 4. You can start testing well people (who, of course, will also likely have shreds of coronavirus DNA in them) and thus inflate your \u2018case figures\u2019 with \u2018asymptomatic carriers\u2019 (you will of course have to spin that to sound deadly even though any virologist knows the more symptom-less cases you have the less deadly is your pathogen.\n\n \n\nTake these 4 simple steps and you can have your own entirely manufactured pandemic up and running in weeks.\n\n\n\nRemember this: They cannot \"confirm\" something for which there is no accurate test.\u201d", "Dallas Cowboys Highlights an unknown virus spreading across 180 countries in a less than months time is out of proportion?", "pspicer777 In about a month or so  people are going to grow very tired of this and will simply be willing to take their chances.

The problem is not knowing. It's mid April and we still do not have any idea of what the ramifications are. \n\n\nHad there been proper testing available in the early stages like say they were in South Korea, then our experts could have identified where the virus came in and quickly contained it in that area. Instead of doing that, the administration was indifferent to it until it was clear this was at the very least much more contagious than many viruses we have seen. \n\n\nFurther, the administration eliminated a key position assigned with pandemic readiness and reassigned most of the people who were working for them to other departments. They say now in retrospect that the primary purpose was not changed. However, that seems to be counter intuitive to them firing the person in charge and reassign those that were assigned the task. That and the reduction of 591 people from the CDC does not lend to any conclusions that this administration took a potential pandemic serious. Oh, and let's not forget pulling Dr. Linda Quick, an expert expert is disease and epidemiologist, from the Chinese CDC just months before the pandemic meaning we had no one in country that could verify facts. She was not thrown out by the Chinese as she was training people in the Chinese CDC. She was removed by the trump administration. \n\n\nIn the end ratings and the economy were more important than American lives.

It is next to impossible to confer causality to an organism based on something as fine grained as a PCR reaction.\nI also do not know in specific what primer set is being used for testing for the COVID-19 virus. If they have a good primer set that is specific to that particular virus, then the results will be very specific, if the primer set is more 'generic' to the family of virus' then will only detect the family.\nKeep in mind that presence of a virus does not mean presence of disease, the person may be immune to the effects (a carrier), could be recovering (inferred future immunity) or actively symptomatic.\nYes, qPCR can detect the viral load, it is what qPCR is designed to do. \nAntibody screens can test for the immune response. The assumption here is that a person got infected, and their immune system has responded - ergo, they had the disease. But in fact they could have had a similar disease (think cowpox giving immunity to small pox). Also, good antibodies can be hard to come by, take a long time to test, and require a certain amount of \"art\" on the part of the technician.\nThe last thing (and maybe the most important) is that the outcome of a PCR test is most dependent on sample collection and handling. My experience is that there is a maximum of about 45minutes of open time before RNA becomes unusable. That is how much time the sample can be above 4C during collection and handing at the clinic, and on the bench in the lab. This is probably the largest contributor to the 40% false negative rate of the test.

Thanks\nThe following is from a medical forum. The writer prefers to stay anonymous, because presenting any narrative different than the official one can cause you a lot of stress and put your career and profession at stake.\n\n\u201cI work in the healthcare field. Here's the problem, we are testing people for any strain of a Coronavirus\u2014not specifically for COVID-19. There are no reliable tests for a specific COVID-19 virus. There are no reliable agencies or media outlets for reporting numbers of actual COVID-19 virus cases. This needs to be addressed first and foremost. \n\n \n\nEvery action and reaction to COVID-19 is based on totally flawed data and we simply cannot make accurate assessments. This is the reason why you're hearing that most people with COVID-19 are showing nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. That's because most Coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. The few actual novel Coronavirus cases do have some worse respiratory responses, but still have a very promising recovery rate, especially for those without prior issues.\n\n\n\n The \u2018gold standard\u2019 in testing for COVID-19 is laboratory isolated/purified coronavirus particles free from any contaminants and particles that look like viruses but are not, that have been proven to be the cause of the syndrome known as COVID-19 and obtained by using proper viral isolation methods and controls (not the PCR that is currently being used or Serology /antibody tests which do not detect virus as such). PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for \u2018viral sequences\u2019, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome.\n\n\n\nThe problem is the test is known not to work because it uses \u2018amplification\u2019 which means taking a very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analyzed. Obviously, any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery.\n\n Additionally, it\u2019s only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues.\n\n\n\nThe Mickey Mouse test kits being sent out to hospitals, at best, tell analysts you have some viral DNA in your cells. Which most of us do, most of the time. It may tell you the viral sequence is related to a specific type of virus \u2013 say the huge family of coronavirus. But that\u2019s all. \n\n\n\n The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even getting into the other issue \u2013 viral load. If you remember the PCR works by amplifying minute amounts of DNA. It therefore is useless at telling you how much virus you may have. And that\u2019s the only question that really matters when it comes to diagnosing illness. Everyone will have a few viruses kicking round in their system at any time, and most will not cause illness because their quantities are too small. For a virus to sicken you you, need a lot of it, a massive amount of it. But PCR does not test viral load and therefore can\u2019t determine if a osteogenesis is present in sufficient quantities to sicken you.\n\n\n\nIf you feel sick and get a PCR test any random virus DNA might be identified even if they aren\u2019t at all involved in your sickness which leads to false diagnosis. And coronavirus are incredibly common. A large percentage of the world human population will have covi DNA in them in small quantities even if they are perfectly well or sick with some other pathogen.\n\n\n\nDo you see where this is going yet? If you want to create a totally false panic about a totally false pandemic \u2013 pick a coronavirus. They are incredibly common and there\u2019s tons of them. A very high percentage of people who have become sick by other means (flu, bacterial pneumonia, anything) will have a positive PCR test for covi even if you\u2019re doing them properly and ruling out contamination, simply because covis are so common.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of flu and pneumonia victims in hospitals throughout the world at any one time.  All you need to do is select the sickest of these in a single location \u2013 say Wuhan \u2013 administer PCR tests to them and claim anyone showing viral sequences similar to a coronavirus (which will inevitably be quite a few) is suffering from a \u2018new\u2019 disease.\n\n\n\nSince you already selected the sickest flu cases a fairly high proportion of your sample will go on to die. You can then say this \u2018new\u2019 virus has a CFR higher than the flu and use this to infuse more concern and do more tests which will of course produce more \u2018cases\u2019, which expands the testing, which produces yet more \u2018cases\u2019 and so on and so on.\n\n\n\nBefore long you have your \u2018pandemic\u2019, and all you have done is use a simple test kit trick to convert the worst flu and pneumonia cases into something new that doesn\u2019t actually exist. Now just run the same scam in other countries. Making sure to keep the fear message running high so that people will feel panicky and less able to think critically.\n\n\n\nYour only problem is going to be that \u2013 due to the fact there is no actual new deadly pathogen but just regular sick people, you are mislabeling your case numbers, and especially your deaths, are going to be way too low for a real new deadly virus pandemic. But you can stop people pointing this out in several ways.\n\n\n\n1. You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are imminent. Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and then claim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.\n\n\n\n2. You can tell people that \u2018minimizing\u2019 the dangers is irresponsible and bully them into not talking about numbers.\n\n\n\n3. You can talk crap about made up numbers hoping to blind people with pseudoscience.\n\n\n\n 4. You can start testing well people (who, of course, will also likely have shreds of coronavirus DNA in them) and thus inflate your \u2018case figures\u2019 with \u2018asymptomatic carriers\u2019 (you will of course have to spin that to sound deadly even though any virologist knows the more symptom-less cases you have the less deadly is your pathogen.\n\n \n\nTake these 4 simple steps and you can have your own entirely manufactured pandemic up and running in weeks.\n\n\n\nRemember this: They cannot \"confirm\" something for which there is no accurate test.\u201d"], "I'm not afraid and feel exactly the same way as Tucker.
