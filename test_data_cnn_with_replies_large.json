Unless we set up mash units that are outside under a tent I don't see how you could ever treat all that get ill, so until then only those who try to do right and wear masks should be in the hospital I'm sorry but it's not right that these people think they should be able to ignore the rights of other people while proudly wearing their face without a mask like I should notice them for being brave or some bull.

I bear the burden of sharing real facts that may be very disturbing of the coronavirus, 5G network, Bill Gates ID2020 vaccinations and the Chemtrails\u00a0sprayed in our skies, yet at the same time I hope I may bring enlightenment removing the\u00a0fear porn that is present happening in the media today! And bring to light what is really happening behind the\u00a0scenes which should horrified\u00a0the public. Something so awful it should bring you out of your homes in defiance of our world leaders.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat I'm about to share with you is my own understanding of what may be taking place right now, not only in our country but also across the world. These are tragic times but there is one answer to the problem! The Wholly Spirit of God, He that Created us in His image. No other!\n\nFirst off I must present how I learned of the 666 matrix we happen to live in. You must read this message and share it with others. All I'm doing is presenting facts about the word magic and numerology our politicians have used to shut down this country and what We, as a nation, as a people must do to take it back, that which was given to each of\u00a0us freely. The land, water, food, and air we breathe. All given freely from our Creator. So let's start with the air We, breath.\n\nToday across our nation, in our skies above us everyday our very own military pilots spray our skies with poisons and do so without questioning their\u00a0orders passed down from their\u00a0Captains, Colonels, and Generals, who in turn receive their orders from politicians, who have aligned themselves with the fallen ones and this 666 matrix I will prove to you we live in...\n\nSo what are they spraying our skies with, and why doesn't anybody know. Why doesn't our government tell us. Why don't they let anybody take samples of the material coming out of the ass end of those military planes. Why is there no dissension from any of these pilots if they know they are spraying poison? I don't have the proof but I'm guessing they are spraying our skies with industrial waste, paying official big bucks to dispose of the corrosive materials that nobody wants. Mostly finite particles I'm sure, metals that we breathe daily,\u00a0now 10 years without Americans saying a word. This alone has caused many deaths and cancers in our society that will continue to grow each day, for the silence of the people gives the authorities the okay.\u00a0\n\nWhat's any of this got to do with a 666 matrix you may be asking. Well let's take the word C.O.R.O.N.A. What is its meaning?\u00a0It means a crown and it has 6 letters in the spelling. Now take the word \"CORONA\" with numerology C3 O15 R18 O15 N14 A1 adding the sum totals 66 Hmm! So could the very word Corona mean 666. Coincidence?! No! There are no Coincidences in this realm. Everything happens for a reason. Which brings me to the reason why they say we must stand 6 ft from one another. Now you have an endless amount of 6's but wait, there's more!\n\nComing out of Wohan they were calling the virus the \"NOVEL\" Coronavirus. Dictionary.com Novel: 1 a fictitious prose narrative of considerable\u00a0length and complexity, portraying characters and usually presenting a sequential organization of action of and scenes. Wow! Hole in the story Batman. So I contend then that those in power are the organization and the actions taking place today are from the principalities! The rulers, and religious leaders. Which brings me to a deeper hidden agenda that they will use as a secondary outbreak.\u00a0\n\nWas there a hidden agenda to shutting down this country.\u00a0Yes! I argue that there was indeed a hidden agenda to take place. Why shut the country down? What happens in the wee part of the mornings why everyone in America is sleeping or on the computer? They are hyper installing the 5G network. Not just 5G network but weaponized 5G maybe installing the 6G network completing\u00a0what was needed for their\u00a0next chess move.\u00a0\n\nYou see our government does things slowly and methodically and every move is a piece on a chessboard. First they start the fake scare of the fake coronavirus shutting down the country so they can install a weaponized 5G network which they will use in unison with the finite particles we breath in the air. Why? They had to first desensitize us with years of spraying the skies. Now we think nothing of it but after a decade of doing so there is something more underlining, something much more nefarious others do not see!\u00a0\n\nWhy do they have 3 Cell towers in our children's school yards? Why is 300,000 volts of power needed in a concentrated area where children play? Don't you understand the energy field that puts off. Would you let your child play on an electrical grid. Why do you think they don't put those in school yards. Any other place on the earth but our school yards?!!! Really America! And you idiots just closed your minds to what is happening.\u00a0\n\nWell if you know anything of power, electrons, protons, and frequencies you would better understand what Tesla was speaking of when He said: \"When thinking of God, think in terms of Frequencies, Energy, and Vibration.\"\u00a0\n\nOur bodies are set up on frequencies, and vibrations. We are nothing but balls of energy inside a\u00a0decaying carcass. So what happens with these towers, they can reverse the magnetron, stacking billions of milla waves on top of each other which will cause a two-element vacuum tube in which the flow of electrons is under the influence of an external magnetic field, used to generate extremely short radio waves. Not just short wave radio waves but the ability to ionize the air we breath, used in conjunction from the fallout of finite particles in the air. They can and will microwave the area we breathe, causing millions to go into respiratory failure. They can do this slowly! Or they can hit you so hard it will cause aneurysm, heart attacks, kidney failure or whatever. All of them will be the cause of the coronavirus they will say which is really radio waves we are being attacked with from our officials,\u00a0pretending we need more of their\u00a0help to save us. That's right!\u00a0\n\nOur politicians then will do what they are designed to do. Point their fingers at each other, lie to the public, then with double talk say. \"See I told You, we shouldn't have opened up the country so soon. As millions start dying in these areas now they have weaponized with the five G. Americans will start screaming for a vaccine. Which brings me to the Bill Gates I.D 2020\u00a0\n\nWhat does C.O.V.I.D. 19 stand for truly. Could the 19 again have hidden meanings. C.O.V.I.D 19 stands for \"Certificate of vaccination identification.\" And since I do pay close attention to the numerology in front of us. I ask what is the\u00a0number 19's true hidden meaning. Is it just the year?\u00a0Possibly but I don't think so. No!. In our own alphabet it could be the letter \"S\" for that snake that deceived us. Or on the tarot cards it means the sun, and the sun is a \"CORONA\" or maybe secretly a hidden meaning like 1 and 9 in our alphabet it would be A.I. If it was on the tarot cards it would be 1 for the magician, the politicians, and 9 for the hermit, the population. Again are these just coincidences? So many different meanings and they all come to an\u00a0ending of magic and machinery and a lot of bullshit.\n\nSo in conclusion to my report. There is a way to defeat what's\u00a0coming. Hit your knees and ask for the full armor of God. Stand out your doors as a community and walk down to your politician offices and tell them no more. GET OUT! YOUR FIRED! WE DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT'S HELP! BEAT DOWN GENERAL'S, AND THE NEWS MEDIA DOORS THEN AND SAY NO MORE! And from here on out anybody that resists stepping down from their position with their lives. Place them in prison with a life sentence.\u00a0\n\nI will call on the Wholly Spirit for you to see the truth!

Therefore, by making this choice, you will be solely responsible for the care you receive when hospitalized. (Meaning, the insurance companies won't cover your care while you were hospitalized.) If you should pass away from complications due to COVID, then the bill for the hospitalization will be passed on to your next of kin.  People only understand something if there is a cost attached to it.  Since people don't value their life or the lives of others, getting them in their wallet may have an affect.  When you wind up in an ICU unit due to COVID, chances are you have to be intubated.  In order to do this they will have to put you in a medical coma.  Why you may ask?....because it is human nature to want to pull that tube out.  Another thing about intubation....the longer you are intubated, the lower the chance of you breathing on your own.  So many of those folks that wind up being intubated, leave in a body bag.  And you are not in an ICU unit for 1 day, you are there for awhile.  ICU units are specialized care, so the cost is most likely triple the normal stay at a hospital.

Whites have different symptoms than blacks so blacks are near death before they figure out soemthing is wrong. A black nurse explained it. Blacks don't get the fever and coughing. They get malaise and muscle pain. They think if they get some rest and sleep they will feel better. No. They just get worse. \nThe other problem is a lack of health care prevention which blacks need more than whites. Vitamin D is the sunshine vitamin. It is made naturally by exposure to the sun. Nobody goes into the media and tells people that a deficiency of vitamin D will mean you either die or get into the ICU but somehow survive. People with high levels of vitamin D get mild cases and get through the disease much faster.\nHowever, blacks have darker skin and get less vitamin D from sunshine so they need even more supplements than whites.\nMy niece is black and has a 2 year-old girl. I got her Vitamin D-3 4,000 IU a day. I also got her a high end Woman's multi-vitamin (fermented) and liposomal C which absorbs better than regular C as it bypasses the Sodium Dependent Vitamin V Transporters in the intestines. \nThe doctor does not understand blacks. They have different symptoms.\nI refuse to wear a mask. It lowers your oxygen level well below the OSHA minimums for a safe work environment. I don't get sick. \nYou do realize that lockdowns will not work for younger people who are healthy and take sufficient supplements. People who get sick are low in D and C and also in zinc. \nKeep up with these lockdowns and we will have a Depression like 1933 when 3 million Americans starved to death. FDR could have ended the Depression in 90 days if he had listened to a proposal from 8 economists at the University of Chicago. It was for 100% money which is based on Lincoln's Greenbacks which were non-interest bearing and the repeal of fractional reserve banking. The money supply contracted through bankruptcies and foreclosures. All he to do was to create 100% money, repeal the Federal Reserve Act and issue enough currency to do business.

No- emergency surgeries have been canceled and ER wards have been partially or completely closed, as people have been at home due to quarantine and accidents have been reduced. Urgent, non-covid cases are concentrated in designated hospitals or wards. If a doctor or nurse is treating covid patients, he or she should not treat ordinary patients without a couple of weeks of quarantine. That is, for other cases, there must be different staff and fully isolated wards or hospitals and staff, who do not care for covid patients. What if a big accident happens and clean care facilities are urgently needed and with absolutely healthy medical staff?\nDo you already have statistics on how many \u201crecovered\u201d from the disease have received a chronic sequelae? Every sensible TV channel has doctors telling cases and advising.\nAsymptomatic carriers of the diseases walk through the streets, shops, workplaces, bars, clubs, swimming pools, beaches, etc. without a mask and do not follow instructions, because they imagine they are healthy. And so the disease spreads. Are you absolutely sure, that as asymptomatic, you will not suffer from any sequelae etc.?  Even doctors do not yet know the consequences of the disease or even certain immunity. New things have been learned about Covid all the time and it has been learned to take better care of.

There was no travel ban to China, there were restrictions. Over 40,000 people came here from China during that time of two months. Over 430,000 Americans have travelled back and forth from the beginning of the ban to today. Italy was first to ban travel between its country and China. His \u2018ban\u2018 came at the same time as Taiwan, Australia's, New Zealand's, Singapore, and the Philippines. And most of the infections came in from Europe which he didn't restrict until it was too late.\r\n\nOn January 31 the NSC begged Trump to ban travel from Europe but Trump REFUSED until March 11 when he finally did. Trump forgot to tell his European counterparts and airlines AND ESPECIALLY HIS AMERICAN BORDER AGENCY so when the ban came into effect we witnessed returning Americans smashed into airports waiting hours to go through border control. Because the TSA had no prior warning, those airports turned into infected Petri dishes.\n\nNo serious politician or commentator called the move to stop travel from China racist when he placed a LIMITED SCOPED ban on China. \r\n\nYes, people did call him racist when he called and continues to call COVID 19 KUNG-FU virus and the CHINESE virus. \r\n\nPeople were certainly concerned about how Americans of Chinese heritage would be treated by the ban. And unfortunately, they were right. Hate crime against anyone looking like they are from China has drastically increased. And even to this day, Trump has refused to acknowledge the racist assaults and hatred. He is pretending it does not exist. \n\r\nOn ONE day on the online reporting site STOP AAPI HATE there were over 650 complaints of racist abuse on Asian Americans. Hate crimes have drastically climbed due to Trump\u2019s preference for the label CHINESE VIRUS or Don Trump Jr referencing on Twitter KUNG-FU virus.

Why aren't the police enforcing what the governor says to do is this a joke or what?

Unless we set up mash units that are outside under a tent I don't see how you could ever treat all that get ill, so until then only those who try to do right and wear masks should be in the hospital I'm sorry but it's not right that these people think they should be able to ignore the rights of other people while proudly wearing their face without a mask like I should notice them for being brave or some bull.

I bear the burden of sharing real facts that may be very disturbing of the coronavirus, 5G network, Bill Gates ID2020 vaccinations and the Chemtrails\u00a0sprayed in our skies, yet at the same time I hope I may bring enlightenment removing the\u00a0fear porn that is present happening in the media today! And bring to light what is really happening behind the\u00a0scenes which should horrified\u00a0the public. Something so awful it should bring you out of your homes in defiance of our world leaders.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat I'm about to share with you is my own understanding of what may be taking place right now, not only in our country but also across the world. These are tragic times but there is one answer to the problem! The Wholly Spirit of God, He that Created us in His image. No other!\n\nFirst off I must present how I learned of the 666 matrix we happen to live in. You must read this message and share it with others. All I'm doing is presenting facts about the word magic and numerology our politicians have used to shut down this country and what We, as a nation, as a people must do to take it back, that which was given to each of\u00a0us freely. The land, water, food, and air we breathe. All given freely from our Creator. So let's start with the air We, breath.\n\nToday across our nation, in our skies above us everyday our very own military pilots spray our skies with poisons and do so without questioning their\u00a0orders passed down from their\u00a0Captains, Colonels, and Generals, who in turn receive their orders from politicians, who have aligned themselves with the fallen ones and this 666 matrix I will prove to you we live in...\n\nSo what are they spraying our skies with, and why doesn't anybody know. Why doesn't our government tell us. Why don't they let anybody take samples of the material coming out of the ass end of those military planes. Why is there no dissension from any of these pilots if they know they are spraying poison? I don't have the proof but I'm guessing they are spraying our skies with industrial waste, paying official big bucks to dispose of the corrosive materials that nobody wants. Mostly finite particles I'm sure, metals that we breathe daily,\u00a0now 10 years without Americans saying a word. This alone has caused many deaths and cancers in our society that will continue to grow each day, for the silence of the people gives the authorities the okay.\u00a0\n\nWhat's any of this got to do with a 666 matrix you may be asking. Well let's take the word C.O.R.O.N.A. What is its meaning?\u00a0It means a crown and it has 6 letters in the spelling. Now take the word \"CORONA\" with numerology C3 O15 R18 O15 N14 A1 adding the sum totals 66 Hmm! So could the very word Corona mean 666. Coincidence?! No! There are no Coincidences in this realm. Everything happens for a reason. Which brings me to the reason why they say we must stand 6 ft from one another. Now you have an endless amount of 6's but wait, there's more!\n\nComing out of Wohan they were calling the virus the \"NOVEL\" Coronavirus. Dictionary.com Novel: 1 a fictitious prose narrative of considerable\u00a0length and complexity, portraying characters and usually presenting a sequential organization of action of and scenes. Wow! Hole in the story Batman. So I contend then that those in power are the organization and the actions taking place today are from the principalities! The rulers, and religious leaders. Which brings me to a deeper hidden agenda that they will use as a secondary outbreak.\u00a0\n\nWas there a hidden agenda to shutting down this country.\u00a0Yes! I argue that there was indeed a hidden agenda to take place. Why shut the country down? What happens in the wee part of the mornings why everyone in America is sleeping or on the computer? They are hyper installing the 5G network. Not just 5G network but weaponized 5G maybe installing the 6G network completing\u00a0what was needed for their\u00a0next chess move.\u00a0\n\nYou see our government does things slowly and methodically and every move is a piece on a chessboard. First they start the fake scare of the fake coronavirus shutting down the country so they can install a weaponized 5G network which they will use in unison with the finite particles we breath in the air. Why? They had to first desensitize us with years of spraying the skies. Now we think nothing of it but after a decade of doing so there is something more underlining, something much more nefarious others do not see!\u00a0\n\nWhy do they have 3 Cell towers in our children's school yards? Why is 300,000 volts of power needed in a concentrated area where children play? Don't you understand the energy field that puts off. Would you let your child play on an electrical grid. Why do you think they don't put those in school yards. Any other place on the earth but our school yards?!!! Really America! And you idiots just closed your minds to what is happening.\u00a0\n\nWell if you know anything of power, electrons, protons, and frequencies you would better understand what Tesla was speaking of when He said: \"When thinking of God, think in terms of Frequencies, Energy, and Vibration.\"\u00a0\n\nOur bodies are set up on frequencies, and vibrations. We are nothing but balls of energy inside a\u00a0decaying carcass. So what happens with these towers, they can reverse the magnetron, stacking billions of milla waves on top of each other which will cause a two-element vacuum tube in which the flow of electrons is under the influence of an external magnetic field, used to generate extremely short radio waves. Not just short wave radio waves but the ability to ionize the air we breath, used in conjunction from the fallout of finite particles in the air. They can and will microwave the area we breathe, causing millions to go into respiratory failure. They can do this slowly! Or they can hit you so hard it will cause aneurysm, heart attacks, kidney failure or whatever. All of them will be the cause of the coronavirus they will say which is really radio waves we are being attacked with from our officials,\u00a0pretending we need more of their\u00a0help to save us. That's right!\u00a0\n\nOur politicians then will do what they are designed to do. Point their fingers at each other, lie to the public, then with double talk say. \"See I told You, we shouldn't have opened up the country so soon. As millions start dying in these areas now they have weaponized with the five G. Americans will start screaming for a vaccine. Which brings me to the Bill Gates I.D 2020\u00a0\n\nWhat does C.O.V.I.D. 19 stand for truly. Could the 19 again have hidden meanings. C.O.V.I.D 19 stands for \"Certificate of vaccination identification.\" And since I do pay close attention to the numerology in front of us. I ask what is the\u00a0number 19's true hidden meaning. Is it just the year?\u00a0Possibly but I don't think so. No!. In our own alphabet it could be the letter \"S\" for that snake that deceived us. Or on the tarot cards it means the sun, and the sun is a \"CORONA\" or maybe secretly a hidden meaning like 1 and 9 in our alphabet it would be A.I. If it was on the tarot cards it would be 1 for the magician, the politicians, and 9 for the hermit, the population. Again are these just coincidences? So many different meanings and they all come to an\u00a0ending of magic and machinery and a lot of bullshit.\n\nSo in conclusion to my report. There is a way to defeat what's\u00a0coming. Hit your knees and ask for the full armor of God. Stand out your doors as a community and walk down to your politician offices and tell them no more. GET OUT! YOUR FIRED! WE DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT'S HELP! BEAT DOWN GENERAL'S, AND THE NEWS MEDIA DOORS THEN AND SAY NO MORE! And from here on out anybody that resists stepping down from their position with their lives. Place them in prison with a life sentence.\u00a0\n\nI will call on the Wholly Spirit for you to see the truth!

If people willingly choose not to follow recommended guidelines, they need to sign this waiver.  The waiver will then be signed, dated and notarized so that it becomes a legal, binding document.

Therefore, by making this choice, you will be solely responsible for the care you receive when hospitalized. (Meaning, the insurance companies won't cover your care while you were hospitalized.) If you should pass away from complications due to COVID, then the bill for the hospitalization will be passed on to your next of kin.  People only understand something if there is a cost attached to it.  Since people don't value their life or the lives of others, getting them in their wallet may have an affect.  When you wind up in an ICU unit due to COVID, chances are you have to be intubated.  In order to do this they will have to put you in a medical coma.  Why you may ask?....because it is human nature to want to pull that tube out.  Another thing about intubation....the longer you are intubated, the lower the chance of you breathing on your own.  So many of those folks that wind up being intubated, leave in a body bag.  And you are not in an ICU unit for 1 day, you are there for awhile.  ICU units are specialized care, so the cost is most likely triple the normal stay at a hospital.
