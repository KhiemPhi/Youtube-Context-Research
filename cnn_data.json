Amen.\n\n26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.\n\n(Does God allows evil as more people are giving support to these people?)\n\n28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. 29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice.

It's how America has and was developed.  In some minds, Law is a problem, and problems demand solutions, but not universally applicable solutions.  So bottom line is there is nothing in the U.S. Constitution and, the worst of all outgrowths of it, Case Law, which is judge-made law, that cannot be avoided or evaded by skillful Lawyering.  All judges are products of their communities; law is very much a product of community.  Lawyering skill comes at a price, and the elite education underlying that skill comes at an enormous price.  At that skill level, that power level, the only law that matters is the law that gets \"me\" what I want, while at the same time preventing you from getting what you want.  And skillful manipulation of the public narrative is a vital part of law in this country.  Some would call it propaganda, but that's not really true in the absolute meaning of the term.

I have always felt this was a horrible evil policy since my high school years and thank goodness in my high school years i did not get swept in this! Also, no drug should of been labled illegal to begin with anyway.

I think that slogan has an unfortunate misperception. Watch a little documentary report via ABC, KOMO News report called \"Seattle is dying\". It shows the decline of this once beautiful city and the rising plight of the homeless due to the unaddressed drug problem. Using our police force to deal with this insidious issue is like putting a band aid on a seething wound, which is unfair to the police. And puts them in an inevitable losing position. David Simon is pointing out the obvious, but not addressing the root issue. The \"war on drugs\" should not be perceived as the \"war on the drug user\", but the drug itself. I think the trickle down affect would then take care of the drug Cartels. Meaning rehabilitate the drug user who no longer desires the drug, then the Cartel has no client. David Simon's approach intentionally or unintentionally demonizes the police and in this highly heated political climate is really not helpful at all. It only polarizes.

out the two offices did not want to get the service I cord for at 10 a.m. in the morning even though we go back 7 years when it's happen just to know when I was outside for 40 minutes to officers had told me they were not going to get my boy no service that was with stairs waiting in my house I tried to explain to them he's entitled to service please don't do this they did not want to give a service cuz we are Afro-American I said please I called my service they've violated me talking and arguing with me that you're not getting enough service to take 2 hours the violated know that is

upstairs 40 minutes why did they do this to my boy no one said to be tonight at treatment in New York state or anywhere else and no one should be upstate doing time for a crime they did not commit I find it to be malicious prosecution constitutional misconduct Genesis unfair Justice a miscarriage of Justice It's upsetting when I go see my son I have to tell him you upstate because you a black man and you are not entitled to EMS service and that I was lied to by the police I have nothing to hide when they have violated us for services it's sad when you have lawyers I tell you don't say nothing and you can't testify in your trial knowing that I was part of the person that called for services for my son at 10 a.m. in the morning they have to start treating people right and fair police

Longed for by millions bereft of its sacred balance, justice brings to the world of men the harmony of God. As a looking-glass reflects the image of man, so does justice reflect the nature of the divine. The measure of the lawlessness of the time is known by the degree of injustice in the world, & today, injustice stalks the poor on every hand.\n\nLegally, justice rules the field of social regulation, of crime & punishment, but fundamentally justice has to do with the laws of God, which work towards harmony & correct relationship. Every injustice, however small, brings disharmony to the whole. Today, so great are the areas of injustice in every land that extraordinary measures are required to prevent total chaos.\n\nInjustice is a denial of man's divine potential; it separates man from man and humanity from God. Throughout the world, many are struggling to free themselves from age-long injustice, exploitation & tyranny; to set down at last the yoke carried by their forebears. We, the watching Hierarchy, commend their struggle, for we see it as the expression of the divine sparks in all men, yearning for freedom & justice. We give them our hand as we gaze with compassion on their plight.\n\nThere are those who would deny that all men have equal rights to a share of God's providence. Those who argue thus have listened only to the voice of the separated self, forgetting that naught that they have & hold but comes to them from God. When men take heed of the voice of God within them they find in sharing & justice the only answer to man's ills.\n\nToday, more & more, that voice of the inner God is being heard. On all sides are arising spokesmen for the dispossessed. The clamor for justice is growing and soon will swell into a crescendo of sound, drowning out the cries for caution which issue from the representatives of the past.\n\nHow can there be two worlds when the world is One? How can there be division when the law is the same for all men?\n\nPresently, men will understand that the suffering of the many is the illness of the whole, & that justice alone will provide the cure. Aid provides but half the answer, though aid is essential now. Justice must blossom fully in the garden of men's hearts & so set all men free.\n\nJustice creates the conditions in which man can know himself as God. Linked to his brother by love, he can take boldly in his hands his future & fashion it according to the blueprint of God. Many desire that future now, blessed as they are with the vision of the whole, yet naught but work & effort will bring it into being, through the manifestation of justice, love & joy.\n\nRemember as you move towards the future that no one takes these steps alone. As brothers, all, must men proceed along the pathway that leads directly to the source. From that very source does justice emanate, relating men in harmony & love.\n\nShare International.", "That's sad.", "This man's blatant racism is overwhelming.

If a police department is defunded, as it is generally understood, you will have fewer police, but the same percentage of racists. Who will fill the gap in law enforcement? Armed white supremacist vigilantes, as in the Bernhard Goetz case in 1984. It failed then, and it will fail now. To dismantle the police, on the other hand, would involve abolishing the police force, and also abolishing the union that protects the racists, and starting over by rebuilding a new police department, with research-based psychological testing to screen out racists and sociopaths. This was done in Camden, New Jersey, in 2013, resulting in a 70% decrease in homicides and a 46% decrease in violent crime since then.

In fact, it will increase racism (because if you defund the police, there will be less money. Less money, more people will be careless, the department will have to recruit EVERYONE, even racists or evil cops). Defunding cops will actually increase evil cops.\n\nIf you want to fix the racial prejudice/police brutality here's a tip: De-emphasize the police. Hire social workers, drug addicts or mental health workers IN the police department. When we see a homeless person who do we call? The police. We see a person having a mental breakdown, who do we call? The police. We se a person having a drug addiction, who do we call? The police.\n\nHow about instead of calling the police... we call social workers to deal with homelessness and add Cops as BACKUP in case things go wrong. We see a person who has drug addiction, who do we call? Drug rehab experts with police as BACKUP. We see a person with a mental breakdown. Who do we call? Mental health workers with cops as SUPPORT/BACKUP in case things go south.\n\nDon't use cops as the solution. Use cops as the backup to your solutions in case things go down. Increase funds so you can train more on the police on de-escalation. Law enforcement should be required to go through racial bias training in addition to building skills in problem-solving, conflict mediation, and de-escalation tactics.\n\nThe majority of law enforcement training emphasizes technical and tactical aspects of policing. There is an insufficient amount of training focused on anti-racism, implicit bias, mental illness, age-appropriate responses, problem-solving, mediation or cultural competency.\n\nNot only would it de-emphasize the police to the point where racial prejudice and police brutality actually decreases, but it would also increase funding for the community. Not only is it easier to hire more people IN the police department, but it's less controversial than defunding the cops, and easily reduce racism.\n\nWe should also increase funding in the police, not for military but for reform tactics. All police aren't evil, bad people. In fact, the problem is that the police do too much stuff. They are already busy patrolling the neighborhood, now they have to deal with drugs, mental health and homeless people. Areas where police can't understand.

Smaller incidents have occurred in the ongoing looting, rioting and protests that are out-shone by Floyd\u2019s death. It\u2019s not that hard to see why there is little media coverage surrounding Dorn\u2019s death as he tried to protect his friend\u2019s pawn-shop from being looted. His death wasn\u2019t the catalyst or big event, but it is someone that should be looked at and covered more. Perhaps another question we should also be asking is why David Dorn\u2019s death was put into the conservative spotlight and not other incidents: He was a former police officer, he was black, and he was killed as he defended a business from looters. His death should honestly in my opinion be talked about more. But To say this only however and refrain from pointing to other deaths and tragedies that have taken place due to police brutality during these protests, as well as due to looting/rioting and before Floyd\u2019s death is not only simply sad, wrong, but also seems to fit an agenda.", "What the hell is going on????

She said current threats have come in the form of emails, \nletters, and posts to social media.  \n \n\u201cMy concern is the large number of white nationalist(s) in our city and other threatening \ncommunications I\u2019ve been receiving,\u201d wrote Jenkins in an email. \n \nCouncilmember Cano did not return messages seeking comment. \n \nMinneapolis mayors have traditionally had a security detail provided by a \nMinneapolis Police officer who also functions as the mayor\u2019s driver. The\n thirteen council members are not given the same protection.  \n \nAsked why Minneapolis Police are not providing security services to the three\n council members, a city spokesperson said MPD resources are needed in \nthe community.  The hourly cost of private security is similar to the \ncost for a police officer, the spokesperson added. \n \nA spokesperson for Minneapolis Police told FOX 9 the department does not \nhave any recent police reports of threats against city council members. \n It is possible a report could have been filed confidentially. \n \nJenkins said she has not reported the threats to Minneapolis Police because she\n has been preoccupied with the dual crisis of the \u201cglobal pandemic and \nglobal uprising\u201d over the killing of George Floyd. \n \nJenkins said the threats have attacked her ethnicity, gender identity, and sexuality.  \n \nThe security detail is being provided by two firms, Aegis and BelCom.  \n \nCity contracts of more than $175,000, if unrelated to an emergency \ndeclaration, need to be approved by the City Council.  A city \nspokesperson said it is not anticipated security costs will rise to that\n level.\n \nThe security services are intended to be a temporary \nbridge until other security measures can be implemented by council \nmembers, the spokesperson said.  \n \nIt is unclear who authorized the expenditures.

It is about how information is presented.\n\nAs an expert medical witness, I have to challenge opposing party experts all of the time.  There are multiple ways to present the same information.  There are multiple ways to skew information.  Just like there are multiple ways to utter the identical words, but imply different meanings depending on the inflections placed on words in tge sentence.\n\nEx:\nInterrogative:  I am going to the movies?\n\nDeclarative:  I am going to the movies.\n\nExclamatory:  I am going to the MOVIES!!!!!\n\nSame words.  Same areangement.  But different meanings.  One must understand the mechaics of language in some cases in order to get correct meaning.\n\nThe government's side has already showed its hand - it is on the side of the cops!\nHow so?\n1. Initially firing cops but no arrest (Union can get jobs back)\n2. Then, slow to arrest Chauvin (required massive protests, rioting and looting)\n3.  Still no arrest of other accomplices.\n4. Government's preliminary autopsy report focused on underlying medical issues but not on acts of airway, neural and vasculature occlusion in the neck as cause of death.  Remember, the State Attorney General (AG) depends on the police to help him/her make and win cases so that he or she can advance his or her political career.  Don't want to piss off the cops nor make them apprehensive about getting cases to the AG to prosecute.\n\n5.  International rioting, protesting, political pressure\n6. Then, finally arrest of other cops at scene who were participatory either by commission or omission\n5. Then arrest of other bad cops.\n6.  But, now the government adds diagnoses of COVID-19, cardiopulmonary disease, and illicit substances to the autopsy report in order to confound the otherwise OBVIOUS determination of death.  The government understands that most laypersons do not understand what PROXIMATE cause of death means.  So, I will explain, in a nutshell PROXIMATE CAUSE OF DEATH means that inspite of everything else going on in the universe, BUT FOR (had it not been for the occurrence of) A SPECIFIC EVENT, THEN DEATH WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED AT THIS SPECIFIC INSTANT IN TIME IN THIS PERSON'S LIFE - DEATH WAS NOT IMMINENT.  So, the language to understand is BUT FOR.  In other words, BUT FOR the prolonged placement of a knee to the back of Mr. Floyd's neck pinning his neck between the forcefully bearing down knee of a cop weighing at least 200 pounds from behind, and a fixed and unmoveable concrete, cement, or asphalt ground in front, causing mechanical compression and collapse of Mr. Floyd's airway, neural and vasculature structures WITHIN his neck, Mr. Floyd would have likely lived another 20+ years even with his underlying medical issues absent any future unforeseeable intervening life-ending event.\n8.  Thus, Mr. Keith Ellison must choose which scenario he wants to emphasize or downplay.  Whether he will choose to implicate and thus condemn the team that he so dearly depends on to bolster his political career or, will he choose the righteous path and give justice to a negro male whose demise was caught on video for the WHOLE planet to see.  God is also watching you Mr. Ellison.\n\nFinally, to Mr. Keith Ellison:\nMark 8:36\u00a0King James Version (KJV)\n36\u00a0For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?", "6 black people have died of  riot and looting  wasn't this whole thing over George Floyd .

These police man did nothing wrong. Floyd died from a heart attack, not asphixiation according to the autopsy report.  He had drugs in his blood that cause respirartory difficulties. That position the cop used to constrain the victim is used all over the world by police officers with no causalities.", "Its a good thing the Minnesota AG is black as I don't think 2nd degree murder charges would be announced if the AG was white. Its unprecedented and its only the first battle ahead of a bumpy road to conviction of all three officers. I hope the jury is fair and takes the video as pure evidence of murder instead of allowing another officer to get away with actions unbcoming of an officer. Its obvious to anyone who watches that this officer held him down on purpose, even as he pleaded for less pressure.  I wish just one other officer said hey man, let up a little. If one person spoke up, maybe things would be different. Speak up when you see something wrong. I hope they all go to jail for years and set an example that any officer in future will bne held account for their actions. You are not above the law when you become an officer of the law. The word \"law\" is becoming meaningless in the USA since 2016. That needs to change for a future with less chaos.", "It takes 7 - 8 seconds for a person to pass out, over 10 seconds could cause serious brain damage or a coma, over 30 seconds would cause death if the person cannot get oxygen back in the lungs within the next 60 seconds. It only takes 1 minute and 38 seconds over all to choke someone to death. They teach you this when you train in self defence/martial arts, first aid courses, nursing and other health care courses. Don\u2019t they require any first aid or self defence training as a police officer in the USA? I\u2019m 100% certain that those 4 police officers restraining George Floyd have knowledge of this. The man had his hands cuffed behind his back, unarmed and defenceless, pinned faced down on the pavement for 8 9 minutes. There weren\u2019t any scuffle, he was wriggling while being pinned by 3 men, barely a struggle if you would even call it that. Those 4 men had total and full control over George. I\u2019m certain that all of those 3 officers on George would felt and realise instantly the moment he passed out and stopped struggling/moving, they could\u2019ve pulled themselves and or Chauvin away from George. Even if let\u2019s say give the benefit of the doubt that Chauvin had to put his knee on the back of George\u2019s neck initially, he didn\u2019t have to hold it there for that long.

This list goes on.\n\nAll of this coincidently following the uprising of armed citizens protesting state lockdowns by occupying government buildings and city centres; Hillary Clinton\u2019s email trial, the FISA investigation and trial, the questionable COVID-19.

And, they should have rolled him to his side so he could breath at his first complaint of not being able to breath.  Pull up the actual arrest videos and watch them closely. First, Floyd is resisting arrest as they try to cuff him at his car door.  He is doing so because he is in possession of drugs.  It's crystal later in the video so stick with me for a moment. He either falls, or drops down purposely, next to his car either because of the drugs in his system, (impairment) confirmed by the toxicology report, or because he was purposely creating a distraction so he could recover his drugs to discard them before the police find them.  When the officer sits him down against the wall he drops a small baggy of a white substance, drugs, and then leans sideways to cover the baggy so the police don't see it. When they walk him to the police SUV, where most videos either end or are blacked out, he drops or falls again and the police pick him up again.  He appears to be impaired throughout the video. BTW, he drove there impaired and would have driven away from there impaired AND according to the CDC every 50 minutes someone in America dies due to an impaired driver! But I digress.  Sometime during the next few minutes he resists again and refuses to get into the patrol SUV.  This is when they put him on the ground.  So who is George Floyd? The man so many have sainted, killed for, looted and destroyed property and lives for?  He's a criminal drug thug to be frank and honest.  Not only was he impaired by drugs at the time of this arrest, he was resisting arrest while in possession of drugs, and he has a criminal history!  The most egregious crime he was convicted of, who knows how many he was never prosecuted for,  was a home invasion where he stuck a gun in the belly of a pregnant woman and threatened to kill her and her baby!!!! Then he pistol whipped her while his thug buddies ransacked her home and stole whatever they wanted! Pieces of S*@!!! BTW, most of the businesses looted and destroyed belonged to BLACK people and at least 7 BLACK people have been killed during these riots, this insanity, and NONE of them were killed by the police!!!

The cops say they think the driver had a gun because he was \u201creaching\u201d (he probably was reaching for his seat belt or the gear shift or seat belt release). My question is why did he play games with the cops by inching up when they said stop? Why did he pull off when they said stop? Why did he pull of again when the officer was in his car? Where did he think he could go and why did he think there were no consequences for his actions? If he was afraid his friend was gonna be hurt why did he leave him?

Where do you find that in the Bible?   BOOK, CHAPTER and VERSE?  Jesus came to SAVE us from ETERNAL DAMNATION!  He didn't come to set up soup KITCHENS, and neither did he sympathize with the  \"Ah, poor me\" types.  In fact he commanded cripples to roll up their mats and follow him, and he didn't  he delegate someone to assist them!  His mandate was to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God. \"Repent, for the Kingdom of heaven is near\". And to prove it by the miraculous signs and wonders accompanying his ministry.  In Matt 6:33, he told people to \"SEEK FIRST the kingdom of God and all these other things will be added as well\".  In Joh 3:3 and 3:5 he told Nicodemus what he should do to enter the kingdom of heaven. Contrary to what some denominations teach, heaven isn't pie in the sky when you die. \"It is given for man to die ONCE and THEN the JUDGEMENT\"!  Contrary to what some people CHOOSE to believe, there is no mention of purgatory in the Bible. Nancy, her coven, and the fake news media seem to think it is O K to lie and make false accusations against an innocent man this side of the grave, because they'll be able to work off their \"misdemeanors\" in purgatory. It doesn't work that way!!  Jesus said to his followers,  \"Be holy as I am holy\". And he said,  \"Many will say on that day,  'Did we not prophesy in your name and heal the sick in your name'?  And he continued,  \"And I will say to them,  'Get away from me you evil doers, I do not know you'\"!  Cuomo can criticize the President of the United States of America as much as he likes, but the Bible says it is GOD who puts men in positions of power. The Bible also warns  \"Touch not my annointed\". The sic dem party and their toadies will pay dearly for what they have done. It will be interesting to see how it all works out.                                      P S.  Re the claim Jesus was a non-violent protestor, who came to support the poor and downtrodden. That was Judas' role!  Thief.  Betrayer. He objected that  very expensive perfume was used to annoint Jesus' feet, and Jesus said to him, ,  \"The poor YOU will have with YOU always but me you will not have\". If you think Jesus was a peaceful protestor, then you, like Judas, will have the poor with you always, and you will forever have to be turning out to march for some injustice. Did Jesus not concern himself with the destitute, thieves, prostitutes etc? Yes, of course, but he came to give them Eternal Life, which according to him, Joh 17:3, is \"To know the one true God and Jesus Christ Whom He SENT\", IN THIS LIFETIME! .....

And the secular media refuses to address this nor does the media care as caring will not achieve their desire to control every person in America.\n\nGeorge Floyd was a dangerous, wicked and vile criminal.\u00a0 \u201cHe had a rap sheet that was long and was dangerous.\u201d \u201cHe was an example of a violent criminal his entire life, up until the very last moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Daily Mail noted that Floyd had been sentenced to five years in prison in 2009 after being convicted on a charge of aggravated assault that came from a robbery in which a woman had a gun pointed at her while the house was robbed.\n\nThe Daily Mail also showed a court document that said Floyd had served five stints in jail, beginning in the 1990s.\u201d\n\nHe also was killed during an arrest for his crime of using a counterfeit bill.\n\nYes, the officer did kill the criminal, and justice should be served as he used excessive force; but why all the rioting for a criminal who preys on people for his own wickedness with no concern for others.\n\nJesus Christ, the thrill of hope, for a sick and weary world\u2014Romans 10:9-10 from the Bible: \u201cThat if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

When the smoke\nclears and the ash settles, is that the day humankind will finally stop\nfighting each other? I believe its truly time for humanity to wake up, look\ninside themselves and ask some real questions. I am not a writer, blogger or\neven a person who tends to be to vocal about my beliefs or opinions, so this\nmay not even come across very well. None the less\u2026.\n\n\nNobody is denying that tragic things happen and that their\nbad people out there. If they are, they have their head buried in the sand. The\nproblem is people\u2019s perception and that is what needs to change. We fight each\nother for so many reasons and sadly most of those reasons are rooted in race,\nreligion, nationality or sexuality. Does it really matter what color your skin\nis, where you were born or what higher power you choose to believe in? Does\nsomeone\u2019s difference, most of which they have no control over, truly effect\nyou? I believe people need to stop identifying with words that are just\ndescriptors. On this planet we have an array of unique individuals. Some have\nwhite skin, some have black skin, and some of something in between. Some come\nfrom places most have never heard of and some are born into a place everyone\nknows. What difference does any of that really make. Did you choose the color\nof your skin, hair, eyes or the place you were born? Is a person with different\nskin color really any different from you then a person who is taller or\nshorter? I think not. \n\n\nI would could be described with many words, but they are\njust that, words. They would only be how someone else would describe me, they\nare NOT who I am. Just like a black person, Asian person or middle eastern\nperson, have words to describe them, but that does NOT make them anything\ndifferent then myself or anyone else I know. We are all people. At our core I\nbelieve we all want the same thing. We want a happy and fulfilling life. We\nwant to be able to walk outside in the sun without fear of being verbally,\nphysically or mentally harmed. We want the means to provide for our families,\nhave a full belly and a warm safe place to sleep. Its mind boggling that\nachieving all of that is so simple in theory yet seems impossible for most to\naccomplish. It\u2019s done with understanding and an open heart. Otherwise known as\nlove. \n\n\nEveryone needs to take moment and look in the mirror. Does\nthat person down the street you hate or constantly talk bad about really affect\nyou and your situation? How much time and energy do you waste on hate? Have I\nmissed the understanding that my attention to something that makes me feel bad,\nonly gives power to that thing and makes me feel worse? Does the person the\nhomosexual man working at the coffee shop choose to love really negatively\naffect my life? The only thing that has any real impact on your life regarding\nany circumstance is your perception of it. If you perceive a person that lives\nthousands of miles away, that believes in a different hire power then you are a\nreal danger to you, then that will become your reality. I see white people,\nblack people, Christians, Muslims, cops and priests all doing bad things. I\ndon\u2019t deny this, but I know that it\u2019s the individual that is making the wrong\nchoice and causing the pain. It is NOT the persons skin color, belief or\noccupation doing it. I know right now there are a lot of people out there with\na lot of hate towards police officers. Yes, there are some bad officers out\nthere, but the majority are good people, trying to make a living like everyone\nelse.\u00a0 \n\n\nThe cycle of hate, violence and inequality needs to be\nbroken. The first step to this change is to change your own perception. The\nplanet only has one race and that is the human race. If we want our lives to be\nfull of peace and prosperity, we need to hold that desire in our hearts for\neveryone. Imagine what this world could be if all nations let go of greed and\nworked together with the goal of improving humanity and our world.

Given that the area was peaceful until the radicals began attacking the East Precinct, there\u2019s every reason to expect things to head downhill.\r\n\r\nZuccotti Park saw rapes, theft and disease under its occupation.

Make America Great Again  We cannot wait that long  for a Covi19 vaccine to be Discovered. Chlorine Dioxide is a very Noble product that has been used for many years satisfactorily throughout the world, not only as a disinfectant , it has also been used to cure people with Cholera , Cancer , Herpes , VIH , Hepatitis , Arthritis , Purify Water , Purify Blood , Cure Our Childrens with Autism Disorder and   Disinfect Our Hospitals , etc.                                    \nYour  Medical Advisors take care of the Pharmaceutical Industry.    I   Like You ,want to take care that no more People  die and I want to invite your medical Advisors to Know why  CHLORINE DIOXIDE is Not BLEACH. Also want to tell You that We do not need a Vaccine We only need  to supply water for daily consumption in 1/2 liter bottles with 10 drops of Chloride Dioxide and in One Week the Virus would be Finished in the USA and  the whole World ...For years I take it My Father , my Mother and thousands  of people Take it. \nMr President Donald Trump .\nWith all my Heart I put this Humble and Nobel Gift in Your Hand.\nGod Bless You and Your Family\nThis is WHAT CAUSES THE CORONAVIRUS Prevents the Oxygen in our lungs from being able to bind and be transported by Hemoglobin in the bloodstream, to all the Cells of the body, causing Hypoxia. Reason why the ability to perform its essential functions is lost, such as: Obtaining energy at the muscular level and transmitting neuronal signals in the brain, among others, which causes our entire body to collapse to death.\n                                                              The Dilute Chlorine Dioxide in water at 0.3%, It is Assimilable in our body in small doses and It has a great Oxidative power that allows you to eliminate \"ANY VIRUSES\" in just 48 hours. Without affecting our Intestinal Flora.                           \nBut the most interesting thing is that it releases a large number of oxygen atoms for each red blood cell in the blood, stopping hypoxia and restoring the patient's health in just a few hours ...                                                                                          \nIt can be administered Orally and Cutaneously in people with mild or acute symptoms, and in severe cases it can be administered intravenously with saline or Nasogastric (only by a health professional). Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is a chemical compound consisting of one chlorine atom and two oxygen atoms. It is a yellowish gas that dissolves in water at room temperature, but it does NOT hydrolyze, it is also a very small compound with a negative charge of Molecular mass: 66,959 g / mol, reason for which it does not require the bloodstream to be transported for its dissociation since it can travel by itself through the blood and directly from cell to cell of our body supplying them with the necessary oxygen to carry out its different functions,\n This is why I am writing to you;\nOur Medical corps from all over the world learned in the different Universities they attended.\nThat Oxygen is obtained by Emoglovin from the Lungs and Transported by the Blood Stream to all the cells of the body, This is where I want to show you that CLO2 can be used. This is the reason why we want each and every one of the world's doctors to find out as this is a safe and very efficient way for them to use in their fight against the coronavirus using CLO2 in the ways outlined above. Oxygen does not necessarily have to be transported by hemoglovin, much less have a pump or heart in perfect condition since, CLO2 moves like an Electric current through every cell in our body and through the same blood stream Providing enough Oxygen to restore its Oxidative and Energetic functions Within each Mitochondria ... This is the main reason why we are Prevent by all means that you know that the covi19 is removed very easily in just a few hours by a dose of CLO2 dissolved in a cup of water and delivered orally, at 3000ppm; or in very serious cases by intravenous or nasogastric route; Of course always under the supervision of a Health Professional. This New Discovery is affecting the interests of Patented Procedures, Equipment, and Medications, but it is not Acceptable for Human Beings to Die just for taking care of the Economic interests of the pharmaceutical industry and of vaccines.\nTo finish my poorly redacted writing. I apologize for not having learned to write .. (If I had teachers and very Excellent but as you can see I was always the donkey of my School) ..                     \nAnd for the record, I'm not saying it.\nDr. RICHARD J. ROBERTS. 1993 Nobel Prize in Medicine. This illustrious physician said the following. The pharmaceutical industry only serves the capital markets. If you only think about the economic benefits then you stop worrying about serving human beings. I have verified how in some cases investigators depending on private funds would have discovered very effective medicines that would have completely ended the disease, but it would not have been profitable because the pharmacists are not interested in curing anyone because their interest is money, so this research is suddenly diverted towards the discovery of medicines that do not cure at all,\nThe Cancer and chemotherapy industries are one of the most lucrative businesses that exist jointly with the million-dollar industry of Vaccines and pharmaceuticals in general.\nMr President Donald  Trump I am infinitely grateful to my Lord God for having allowing You to Make  America Great Again where the health of human beings has been prohibited and denied by dark interests that have curtailed us to the right to leave the world.

I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do.\r\n\r\nAll Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd.  My administration is fully committed that, for George and his family, justice will be served.  He will not have died in vain.  But we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an angry mob.  The biggest victims of the rioting are peace-loving citizens in our poorest communities, and as their President, I will fight to keep them safe.  I will fight to protect you.  I am your President of law and order, and an ally of all peaceful protesters.\r\n\r\nBut in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa, and others.  A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents.  Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street, or the woman in Upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs.\r\n\r\nSmall-business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed.  New York\u2019s Finest have been hit in the face with bricks.  Brave nurses, who have battled the virus, are afraid to leave their homes.  A police precinct station has been overrun.  Here in the nation\u2019s capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial have been vandalized.  One of our most historic churches was set ablaze.  A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed.\r\n\r\nThese are not acts of peaceful protest.  These are acts of domestic terror.  The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God.\r\n\r\nAmerica needs creation, not destruction; cooperation, not contempt; security, not anarchy; healing, not hatred; justice, not chaos.  This is our mission, and we will succeed.  One hundred percent, we will succeed.  Our country always wins.\r\n\r\nThat is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.  I am mobilizing all available federal resources \u2014 civilian and military \u2014 to stop the rioting and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights.  Therefore, the following measures are going into effect immediately:\r\n\r\nFirst, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country.  We will end it now.  Today, I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets.  Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.\r\n\r\nIf a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.\r\n\r\nI am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D.C.  What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace.  As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property.\r\n\r\nWe are putting everybody on warning: Our seven o\u2019clock curfew will be strictly enforced.  Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested, detained, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\r\n\r\nI want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.  This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence.\r\n\r\nOne law and order \u2014 and that is what it is: one law.  We have one beautiful law.  And once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you, we will help your business, and we will help your family.\r\n\r\nAmerica is founded upon the rule of law.  It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom, and our very way of life.  But where there is no law, there is no opportunity.  Where there is no justice, there is no liberty.  Where there is no safety, there is no future.\r\n\r\nWe must never give in to anger or hatred.  If malice or violence reigns, then none of us is free.\r\n\r\nI take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country.  By far, our greatest days lie ahead.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.  And now I\u2019m going to pay my respects to a very, very special place.

I want you to know that these events have not gone unnoticed and that I condemn them in the strongest possible terms, and that I also acknowledge that this is an extraordinarily challenging moment for many on our staff.\nThroughout its history, Brookings scholars have taken powerful positions on issues of inequality and inequity in America.  These matters are extraordinarily important to me and to whom we are as an institution.  We will not stand for inequality and injustice in our society.  We will continue to take strong and unambiguous public positions that support the inclusion of minority, underserved, and vulnerable populations.  Our voice matters a great deal in this moment, and I am very proud of those members of our community who continue to write and speak out on issues of race, racism, and inequality in America.  Brookings now, and in the future, will serve as a beacon of light on behalf of social justice and opportunity for every Black American, and a loud voice of condemnation of the bigotry and racism on full display by these latest acts, but more broadly characteristic of American society.\nAt the same time, I recognize that the systemic nature of this issue permeates all that we are and do as a nation.  You\u2019ve heard me say before that slavery was America\u2019s \u201coriginal sin.\u201d  Slavery was not solved by the founders of the American Republic, nor was it resolved by the framers of the Constitution of the United States of America.  It was not ended, nor was it ultimately settled, by the horrendous bloodletting of the American Civil War, a war that could not have been won by the Union without the service of hundreds of thousands of Black Americans who were central to the victory of the North and the end of slavery as an institution.  Yet, in many ways, the most odious vestiges of slavery have persisted in America even to this day, and these latest tragedies are simply a continued manifestation of that terrible and brutal legacy.\nIn this regard, I want you to know that the anger and fear you may be feeling right now is perfectly natural, completely understandable, and entirely acceptable.  These feelings are deep, they are raw, and they may feel overwhelming.  It is easy to feel helpless or \u201cstuck\u201d as violence rages seemingly all around us.  Indeed, especially in this COVID-19 environment, when we have so many challenges weighing on our shoulders, moments like these can hit particularly hard.  Please know that I and your institution stand with you.  Please know that Brookings will not be silent about these and other injustices, crimes, and depredations.  We will call out systemic racism, and we will call out unrepentant racists\u2014 and we will continue helping to move the country toward racial equity through our writing, research, and policy suggestions.\nOur Inclusion & Diversity Committee will follow up soon with opportunities to provide spaces for expression as well as resources to become better informed on what racism and white privilege are, and how to work through these challenging times.  Brookings strives to be a community for all, and our commitment to inclusion, respect, and collegiality is ironclad.  That will never change.\nMy very best,\nJohn R.

Violence is impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all. It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his understanding: it seeks to annihilate rather than convert. Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible. It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue.

CNN the problem is, you, the bias media who treat minorities as you want them, like slaves for your purpose. Minorities REALITY CHECK!! I am NOT a Democrat, NOR A DAMN RACIST!! You have to ask yourselves, be SMART, for decades your neighborhoods have been run by Liberals. DECADES!! Nothing is working!! Nothing!!! Liberals are the ones dividing America, no one else. Racism exists, but not the way the media is brainwashing you to believe it is!! I feel for the Floyd family, for minorities. This LIAR pretending she has emotion is crying for her supposed blessings? spare me, Brooke, you are NOT A JOURNALIST!! Journalism in this country is DEAD!!! These people are part of the elite \"Caucasians\" lying to minorities. Race is something that divides us through out sweat glands. Nothing more!! Caucasian is a race with different shades, just like being an African from Morocco (whom are racially Caucasians). So, to the minorities, USE YOUR BRAIN PEOPLE!!! Liberals have been running the black neighborhoods, and so on. This makes me angry her CROCODILE TEARS!! What about Black on Black crimes? She wants access to homes? She wants access from resources? GET RID OF YOUR LIBERAL LEADERS LADY!!! It is NOT ABOUT RESOURCES BEING A COLOR!!! No one will put you down, but yourself!!! Ask yourself, who is running your counties? Your mayors, your dumb LIBERAL LEADERS!!! Also, Mr. Louis Farrahkan or whatever you call yourself, when will you ADMIT, that the Koran, under Muhammed, encouraged slavery, and still today in Muslim countries they refer to blacks as Ab'ed which in Arabic means SLAVE!!! My Fiance is half Christian from Iraq, and believe me, we know facts, because as a minority themselves, the Christians in the Middle East are treated horribly, even though Mesopotamia was their home before any Muslim who killed, and mamed his way to the North. So, spare us the lies!!To the youth, please, before jumping off of a cliff, and ruining  yourselves, educate yourself. No one is putting you down, no one can dare in America, but, urinating on statues of the founding fathers, or flag of America will not change history. You are wanting to change your future, not history. You can only learn from history, and make America which is your country too just as much as  an prissy Liberal Hollywood idiot. Don't support these people, who have HIJACKED your history to exploit it, or lose it to imbeciles who want you dependent on them so they can keep you down!! That is how the Liberals use minorities. They want you on welfare, or on programs dependent on them, so they can keep you down. So, when you want something they have you exactly where they want you. They call the shots because you are not an independent thinker, but, a person enslaved to them.  The very losers on CNN treating you like victims, and poor people, when everything is up to you. Already, they intend on keeping you at the bottom with their \"Planned Parenthood\", knowing your daughters will be pregnant before they are even \"women\" themselves. Wake up!! You want change, you have to educate, and nurture your brains. You want to leave poverty, stop being dependent on Liberals who use those programs to treat you, and keep you down!!! They will continue to do so. You will not see change. You want black children adopted like accessories by stupid Hollywood cunts with no brain, like Madonna, Charlize Theron who already by the time her child is 5 is dressing him like a girl? Kids that age are not sexually aware of themselves. Liberal Hollywood are celebs who are given everything because they are the children of parents in the industry. Look at who the young actors today are? LOL These brats want you to believe they know what it is like for a hard working man who gets up everyday to go to work, to feed his family? They want you to think they identify with you, but they have succeeded in the industry. However, still they are bitching about racism. Especially these rappers who make millions off of you? Use your brains. Don't listen to these multi millionaire rappers who sit in homes like palaces, with every security known to man, and yet, they want you to believe they identify with the black man on the street. These liberals have hijacked George Floyd's death for their agenda. The lowest of low have taken over these marches, and pushed even George out of the picture for their movements that are Marxist agenda's. BLACK LIVES DO MATTER 1000000000%, but not the movement. It is the expression I believe. Where are these celebs with you? Are they only on the front taking pictures then disappearing? Or that idiot from London putting down America, and saying its a racist country when he is already an established actor in Hollywood, and working on American soil? Use your common sense people! Please!! The  Liberals want you once again enslaved making empty promises so,in the end, they can break them. These people DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU!! In history those who have backed you up, and actually believed in the constitution that ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL are conservatism. The media will tell you that we are racist, and we hate minorities, which is furthest from the truth. They are so evil, they have LIED, OVER, AND OVER AGAIN, about Conservatism. When in truth it is the only party more close to Black Americans, and their values which keep family, religion, and encourage you to be successful. If you believe the bimbo in this video, and her crocodile tears i feel for you. Deception is the key with these Liberals, look at her horrible acting, and just her kissing ass. We know the lady sings great, but, she is no Whitney for you to be crying!!! Whitney Houston, Prince, all conservatism followers were murdered by Liberal Hollywood. Remember that!! Listen to people like Morgan Freeman who actually has an IQ, who was asked by a black journalist \"do you believe that racism exists in America?\" Freeman replied by saying \"No, I am proof of that, and so are you.\" to the man. Look at all these athletes? actors? doctors? all of them who have made it, they are trained to believe that blacks are targeted by whites when in reality more Caucasian men were murdered by cops last year then black. These people want you to be needy, and handicapped. Don't!! Free your mind from the liberal lies, and how they lie. The Obama administration deported more illegals then the Trump administration but the LYING MEDIA WILL NOT TELL YOU THAT!! You are such fools these idiots on CNN, ABC, who are NOT journalists, but lying Marxists brainwashing you, have you running around saying \"fuck FOX\" like a bunch of uneducated, losers. That is what they want, because that way they can continue ruining your neighborhoods. Ask yourself? Has this been working for me, the last few decades? Look at the anger, and hatred it has brought you. Don't divide America. I have never looked at my hero's, some whom are of Black African decent as a color, but admired them as REAL MEN!! For GOD SAKE, wake up, we had a Black president for 8 years, how is this country racist? Or better yet, what did he do for black lives?

It's kinda like poison, spreading hate that builds on itself, y'know? I understand reading YouTube comments can be a rather weary and foolish endeavor, and I don't know if voicing my thoughts will make much difference, but I feel that if even a few words can make a positive difference, then I want to give it a try.\r\n\r\nI live in the U.S. and I've watched videos from various news sources such as CNN, Fox, and MSN. I've looked into the perspectives of the Republicans and the Democrats to try and understand both sides of our very divided nation at this point in time. I want to try my best to share my own view on how I believe things are going based on facts that some may consider 'fake news' or not. How is one to believe everything that is told through the news? I'd like to think that though each news outlet may lean politically one way or another, an intelligent person can glean the kernels of truth that the news does share and not allow their own personal agenda to cloud their reasoning.\r\n\r\nI've watched many videos that portray both Trump and Biden and I feel that even though Biden may not be perfect and makes mistakes, I believe his leadership would help pull America out of our current crises of this terrible pandemic and racial injustice that is plaguing the nation. Sure, he's made a few gaffs and said some things that may have been insensitive, but at least he does have the decency to apologize when he makes mistakes. He's treated Trump with much more dignity and respect than the president has shown to him. I myself would have preferred Sanders, but I suppose Biden would have a better chance of becoming president as he appeals to a wider demographic.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have seen of Trump, my perspective is that he seems to lack empathy and compassion for others. Whenever anyone says anything that challenges him, he is quick to retort and often in a derogatory fashion. His actions tend to favor him over all others and from the research I've done, his adminstration seems to favor the wealthy and corporations that often exploit the common worker. His view of women appears quite chauvinistic which I find to be rather unbecoming of the office of the president. There's also the fact that over 120,000 Americans have died from this pandemic and over 40 million jobs have been lost and there is much civil unrest because of the death of George Floyd. Instead of taking steps to repair the damage that has been done, the president continues to express words that divide our broken nation instead of offering empathy and comfort in these trying times.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with what I've said, that is your right. But I just wanted to point out these dark times in my own words, to be heard. I also do find that it does no good to disparage others who have a differing opinion from your own, but to try to see their own perspective before slandering them and calling them names because you dislike what they have to say. This goes for all sides. Constantly mocking the president for his mistakes doesn't make things better, but allowing him to do whatever he feels like is not good either.", "Joe Biden is a stupid liar of his generation!", "How come they are so defensive for Biden but not from trump???", "Bruh.... wtf....

The reason blacks have higher rates of death from the CCP virus is due to vitamin D3 defficiency, most dark skinned people in North America are defficient as their skin will not allow light to enter into the fat layer under their outter pigmentation which reacts with UVB light to produce vitamin D3. Our bodies cannot make this vitamin (actually acts as a hormone) any other way.  Lung infections from viruses are 70 percent less with enough vit. D3,  as opposed to deficient.

Furthermore, preventative measures such as (Hydrochlorocline?) have been shamed by the likes of CNN on the basis of flawed studies. Rather than blame some fort of prejudice for higher instances of Covid in the African American community maybe we should be asking why organizations push agendas that seek to sow division rather than attempt to present facts that improve health.

I wonder if the military is aware that that is an outdated concept? I mean, if they knew, they could come home, play with their kids, and stop being killed to.....what? Oh yeah, risking death to give you and I liberties.\nYes the numbers change inre to the death count. You say because of the source, you got that one right! Statistics can be manipulated, and often are. The integrity of the source, as well as its qualifications, certifications, and expertise on the issue being discussed, are the factors one must look at when utilizing stats. \nThe death toll, is a fact; however, the numbers change for several reasons: who's counting? If Trump, or any of his staff are counting,  the numbers are wrong. Several reasons for this, trump is an idiot, that's 1, Trump needs the reopening to happen, the economy is his only stance in the upcoming election, that's 2, trump is such a frigging nut, his staff is afraid to cross him for fear of being fired, that's 3. There are more reasons, big one too, people are still passing, every day, it brings the number up mr. Jones. \nComparing covid to noncomunicable ailments, such as heart disease, diabetes, or obesity, is just bad logic. \nTell me when was the last time America had so many citizens die in such a short time? The flu season? Hmmmm, nope. \nYes, every year, people die, every year, we lose the elderly, the young, the healthy, and even the ignorant (like yourself), this does not compare in any way to those unfortunate deaths. Chance of a 69 year old man, contracting a fatal illness from eating at a restaurant, going to the grocery store, or walking to the park with his grand kids, Is, in normal times, pretty slim. Yes, it there, but nowhere near what is happening now. \nYour anger and frustration is valid. YOUR elected leaders incompetent handling of this situation, coupled with your obvious lack of compassion, your inability to recognize actual suffering over being  inconvenienced , your callous lack of any type of guilt or remorse concerning your stance on this subject. the random luck that placed you hear, instead of you being born elsewhere, your blatant lack of understanding of the difference between personal freedoms and actual rights, and your blindness to the the fact that you re being played, used, lied too, well, I might act like you, too. \nNo, let me correct that, I wouldnt act like you. I can't  spout rhetoric and lies, regurgitating the evil harmful, and hurtful words that are ths backbone of the potus, his heroes at fox news, or what I like to call fox, the standby employee pool for the executive branch. I wouldnt take up arguements on subjects I hadn't even bothered to look into in responsible manner, and I for sure wouldnt out others at risk, so that I could prove myself right, or just to be a penis. \nGive me liberty, hah. I have liberties, no one needs to die so that I may have them, thousands before me have already done so, that's how I got them.\n \"Shut up\", you say. Funny, THAT IS A RIGHT! One afforded to me by the Constitution. Of course you would try to usurp that right.  It's like guns, in order for that right to be taken away from you, 2/3 of the states would have to agree to it. Not a law passed by Congress, or a fantasy imagined by the far left. Yo need to look at things with an open mind, not biases that stem from someone else's fetish mind. \nAs to fear....well, maybe you know fear. Where else does such strong paranoia and hatred come from? Unfortunately, your loathsome inner cowerings ante exposed weakness in your belief that fear = weakness. I would explain this to you but, why? You wont change. I kind of envy you. Your belief that we have this inner enemy existing next door, your simple ideologies, bigotry, hatred, and psychotic trust of people who have only your worse interests at heart, that must be a very comforting place to be when facing reality.
