Yeah, I'm sure there will be no slacking off with the guidelines.\n\nSimply put, this is going to be a disaster. Schools are going to be the new outbreak hotzones. Kids are going to pass the virus around to each other en mass, MORE teachers will die, along with parents and guardians. And of course, the kids themselves. And even those that survive will likely be facing physical and mental problems for the rest of their lives due to the destruction the virus causes on the body and brain tissue.\n\nThere is no way in hell I would EVER send my child in to deal with those threats.\n\nThe school systems in North America (cause Canada's not much better) are a joke. They have constantly lowering standards. Ever increasing class sizes due to governments not wanting to properly fund schools (despite all the lies they tell about how much they care about education). Ever growing problems with bullying and teen suicide. Drugs, violence, guns, etc...\n\nNo. Schools can't even handle the basic issues they're supposed to deal with. There's no way in hell they're going to be able to properly handle being open during a pandemic.\n\nIf you want your kids to learn, then teach them yourself or set them up with online learning (which most schools are still offering, and some are ONLY doing it that way).\nFor those who complain that kids will be lonely without school and have no one to talk to... are you stupid? Have you seen how easy it is for kids to chat with each other online? Hell, a lot of teens spend more time with friends online than they do in person these days (even pre-pandemic). Socializing is NOT a problem.\n\nNow, there is the issue for people who need to go to work and can't be around to care for their kids. That's legitimate. Of course it's also the governments responsibility to be taking steps to help with that. That's their role during a pandemic. People can't work and watch the kids, so resources need to be given out to families to help get support.\n\nIn my neighbourhood there's a few houses that are basically \"daycamps\" at this point. People who are tested regularly, who take in small groups of children (so that the total exposure is limited). There might be a dozen youngsters who spend their off time in those places, while their parents work. Where the kids go and who they interact with is always closely monitored to make sure there's little risk of outside exposure.\n\nThis is something just good hearted folks in the community set up.

That Trumps been pushing needs to truly make himself look good. He has totally hogtied the agencies that know what the safety testing of anything as well as the dangers of does and don'ts of any form of vaccinations being tested on human guinea pigs at this point. As well as Trumps dangerous actions of no mask wearing and stating that its a freedom of speech action going on when he started the so called opening up of the country. The fireworks display he held at Mt. Rushmore. And mad mask wearing an option. The way seating at this monument is a shoulder to shoulder type of seating. Masks should of been MANDATORY PERIOD. Better yet not held at this point in the country at all. The fact his family and staff are tested daily is so far beside the point and the facts of what is happening to the people of our country. Should of been the only point period.\nHe current statements either by him directly or by his press secretary at this moment and time during a new or continuing rise in the number of people coming down with covid 19. Being a blimp due to his continuation of blaming CDC, WHO, or the IHA of being responsible for all of the \"false reporting\" .  Is again his way of blaming everyone and every agency to deflect from himself is beyond reason. As well as the Trump way of covering his ass. And sadly his base of followers just keep helping him spread the false belief of the truth. Truths that were the actual truths of how its spreading, and sadly not being a true leader and wearing a mask. And having staff and family do the same. Only makes things happening in states and our hospitals so much more dangerous for our Front line folks. Who are putting their lives in danger already a nightmare all over again. And opening up schools until this virus is so much further under control. With statements of kids just do not catch it like grownups. Is the same as saying. \" at least that's a good enough reason to send them back to school\". \nLeaving out the parts of kids share everything constantly but their be ok. Not mentioning anything about teacher's that are older as well as support staff in schools. Or the fact of the amount of kids who when school day is out. A large number of them are putting grandparents or other family members in danger. Is worth the risks involved. \nHe is so panicked about the November election and his pole numbers. He could care less about the people on the frontlines of all of this that he even failed to follow through with his promise of making sure to have the country able to get all the PPE supplies they needed still from the last wave. As well as hospital staff and doctors offices being able to stay safer than before. \nGiven the fact that it is the start of fire season in a large amount of states. And the number of first responders that are going to be pulled off covid 19 frontlines to fight them. As well as the shelters that will be needed to put people in for their protection as well as the loss of homes. Flu season just around the corner. Mix it all together and he and his family will be safe. But the rest of the country will be screwed.\nIts no wonder that there are states joining together to keep their states safe and are mass buying what they already know will be needed before and afterwards. States he at first called well governored. Until he realized a lot of these states were blue not red and now they are putting the rest of the country in danger.\nWrong answer Mr. Trump. You already have been doing that since the covid19 virus hit the U.S. by lying directly to the people about the virus and the fact it was headed this way. You closed down the pandemic tracing office right off the bat of your presidency. And then once shit hit the fan. Thought it would be better to not tell people and just let it wipe through the country and take out the weak. Leaving the strong to survive. Until it was explained by your staff and medical professionals that not a good idea. Especially since this virus was one never seen before and was totally  unknown as how it truly spread from person to person. So this nightmare our country has been going through. And will continue to do so due to you continuation of blaming other countries and past administration's to cover your own ass. Well sorry to say your contutation of your actions.

FACT", "*Dear All, please read it carefully. It's not related but very very important*\n\nChina learns Religion from India (Gautama Buddha) {Bodh Gaya}. China learns martial arts from India (Indian Buddhist priest named\u00a0Bodhidharma). China learns mediation from India. But after Mao brings communism (Communist) they become violent, liar, propagandist, aggressive on other countries, capturing other countries property etc. \n\nChina can't fight with India. India has a huge population who knows English well. So every Indian should step up their attacks and spread awareness against China and Chinese product across Globe. \n\n1. China makes highest counterfeit product in the world. It leads to huge revenue loss for genuine companies across world. It's impossible without CCP (Communist party of China) knowledge.\n\n2. The region China and India has dispute is actually Indo-Tibet not China. Dalai Lama lives in India. Lakhs of Tibetan lives in India and fight for independence of Tibet. It will not easy for China to fight against India in Tibetan region. If Indian Army enter in Tibet, Communist Army of China will get a tough fight.\n\n3. China probably exported Covid 19 across globe purposefully. One Chinese women or a communist agent spread the virus in South Korea. Chinese or leftist purposefully organize Hug a Chinese campaign in Italy. After that program entire European Union is suffering now.\n\n4. Communist China wants to divert issues from Covid to other things. That's why they are aggressive with India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia etc. Beijing's communist party probably ordered Communist Army to attack/aggression towards India and other South Asian Countries.\n\n5. Communist China is the reason why Illegal poacheing happens in the world. Rich communist Chinese has used medicine made out from animals organ. Those medicines are really costly one, Rich communist are paying huge money for buying exotics animals organ. Many communist eat Tiger penis, that is also a reason why poachers killed tigers.\n\n6. China is using Pakistan and leftist liberal of India to disturb India and they are using North Korea to disturb America, South Korea, Japan etc. It was probably China who illegally transfer nuclear technology and machinery to Pakistan and then by the help of Pakistan, they were exporting nuclear technology to Iran and North Korea. China wants to destabilize India, South East countries, Japan, Arabic country specially Saudi Arabia, UAE etc and America, as well as they want to sell their product at the same time. So they need some small countries like Pakistan, N Korea etc who takes orders from Beijing's communist party. *Normally Indian are focusing on Pakistan, American are focusing on North Korea & Iran, Saudi's are focusing on Iran. South Korea is focusing on North Korea. But they do not focus on China the real brain behind Pakistan, North Korea and others.*\n\n7. Communist China illegally claim almost entire South China Sea as their property. South China Sea is very high in natural resources and a very important sea route. That's why greedy communist wanted to capture almost entire South China Sea. What if India declare Indian ocean as India's property? Is that legal? No...\n\n8. *Communist China gives money to Pakistan and Pakistan probably gives money to terrorist organization like Laskar, Jaish, Taliban etc.* China and Pakistan wants to kick out America from Afghanistan. They (China+Pakistan) are creating pressure on both America & Afghanistan. It's impossible for any terrorist organization like Taliban, Laskar, Jaish, Hizbul to survive without it's parents China & Pakistan. *These terrorists organization neither have AK47/bullet manufacturing plant nor Chemical/Explosive plants. All the weapons and fund is probably provided by Pakistani Army.* Pakistani Army gets fund from Chinese nowadays and earlier it was another country who funded Pakistan. *Communist China called Dalai Lama a Terrorist and defend Pakistani terrorist in United Nation.*\n\n9. *Probably Communist China along with some leftist, liberal organization of India is trying to divide Indian Society. Trying to put hatred among each others.* Communist are also trying to divide European Union. Due to Covid economy of every country is affected badly. Soon Gulf countries will fall in trap of Chinese debt. Millions of people will lose Job due to Covid across Globe.\n\n10. Communist China is not intellectually rich country. They are rich in Cash because other countries are not closing their doors to looters of China. Communist China is using Indian people's money against India and Americans money against America. They sell product in India, America, Europe and then they use same money to destabilize the same country where they sell products. *If India, US and European Union block their Market against Chinese Companies or people started boycotting Chinese goods then China will be paralyzed.* *#BoycottChineseProduct**#*\n\n11. There were/are always allegations that Communist China is a Data theif. *They always probably trying to stole valuable data or technology from other country.* There is no democracy in China and Communist make people Robots. Means Chinese people have to Work, Think, Act as per communist party, they don't have independence. No one can ask question in China independently.\n\n12. *India had already banned 59 Chinese App. China had banned American App like Google, YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp etc but people are waiting to see strong action against Chinese bully by US & EU.* India, Australia, Japan will stand by US & EU. But unfortunately most of the big corporate of US & EU is operating from China. China do earn revenue from them and used the same money against US, EU, India, Australia, Japan etc. It's time to move out factories from China. Many believes China's biggest success is to loot US, EU and other countries.\n*Note : China has probably started a economic war & press some small countries to review deal with India, Japan, Australia, US etc...*\n\nAn appeal to all Youth of India & other parts of world, if all started to campaign against China, communist China will have taste their own medicine. Yes communist will use their paid propagandist, they could use huge money for propaganda but truth can't be hidden. But remember, War couldn't be won only by money or weapons, how much you love your country that is important. Start campaign against Communist China....The message should reach each social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube etc etc. *We are not against China but against Communist aggressive ideology.*\n\n*#FreeTibet**#FreeHongKong**#FreeTaiwan**#*\n\n*Please Share.* (Screenshot)", "Acosta the halfbreed got owned!", "@Scurra Your missing something bro.

It's not related but very very important*\n\nChina learns Religion from India (Gautama Buddha) {Bodh Gaya}. China learns martial arts from India (Indian Buddhist priest named\u00a0Bodhidharma). China learns mediation from India. But after Mao brings communism (Communist) they become violent, liar, propagandist, aggressive on other countries, capturing other countries property etc. \n\nChina can't fight with India. India has a huge population who knows English well. So every Indian should step up their attacks and spread awareness against China and Chinese product across Globe. \n\n1. China makes highest counterfeit product in the world. It leads to huge revenue loss for genuine companies across world. It's impossible without CCP (Communist party of China) knowledge.\n\n2. The region China and India has dispute is actually Indo-Tibet not China. Dalai Lama lives in India. Lakhs of Tibetan lives in India and fight for independence of Tibet. It will not easy for China to fight against India in Tibetan region. If Indian Army enter in Tibet, Communist Army of China will get a tough fight.\n\n3. China probably exported Covid 19 across globe purposefully. One Chinese women or a communist agent spread the virus in South Korea. Chinese or leftist purposefully organize Hug a Chinese campaign in Italy. After that program entire European Union is suffering now.\n\n4. Communist China wants to divert issues from Covid to other things. That's why they are aggressive with India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia etc. Beijing's communist party probably ordered Communist Army to attack/aggression towards India and other South Asian Countries.\n\n5. Communist China is the reason why Illegal poacheing happens in the world. Rich communist Chinese has used medicine made out from animals organ. Those medicines are really costly one, Rich communist are paying huge money for buying exotics animals organ. Many communist eat Tiger penis, that is also a reason why poachers killed tigers.\n\n6. China is using Pakistan and leftist liberal of India to disturb India and they are using North Korea to disturb America, South Korea, Japan etc. It was probably China who illegally transfer nuclear technology and machinery to Pakistan and then by the help of Pakistan, they were exporting nuclear technology to Iran and North Korea. China wants to destabilize India, South East countries, Japan, Arabic country specially Saudi Arabia, UAE etc and America, as well as they want to sell their product at the same time. So they need some small countries like Pakistan, N Korea etc who takes orders from Beijing's communist party. *Normally Indian are focusing on Pakistan, American are focusing on North Korea & Iran, Saudi's are focusing on Iran. South Korea is focusing on North Korea. But they do not focus on China the real brain behind Pakistan, North Korea and others.*\n\n7. Communist China illegally claim almost entire South China Sea as their property. South China Sea is very high in natural resources and a very important sea route. That's why greedy communist wanted to capture almost entire South China Sea. What if India declare Indian ocean as India's property? Is that legal? No...\n\n8. *Communist China gives money to Pakistan and Pakistan probably gives money to terrorist organization like Laskar, Jaish, Taliban etc.* China and Pakistan wants to kick out America from Afghanistan. They (China+Pakistan) are creating pressure on both America & Afghanistan. It's impossible for any terrorist organization like Taliban, Laskar, Jaish, Hizbul to survive without it's parents China & Pakistan. *These terrorists organization neither have AK47/bullet manufacturing plant nor Chemical/Explosive plants. All the weapons and fund is probably provided by Pakistani Army.* Pakistani Army gets fund from Chinese nowadays and earlier it was another country who funded Pakistan. *Communist China called Dalai Lama a Terrorist and defend Pakistani terrorist in United Nation.*\n\n9. *Probably Communist China along with some leftist, liberal organization of India is trying to divide Indian Society. Trying to put hatred among each others.* Communist are also trying to divide European Union. Due to Covid economy of every country is affected badly. Soon Gulf countries will fall in trap of Chinese debt. Millions of people will lose Job due to Covid across Globe.\n\n10. Communist China is not intellectually rich country. They are rich in Cash because other countries are not closing their doors to looters of China. Communist China is using Indian people's money against India and Americans money against America. They sell product in India, America, Europe and then they use same money to destabilize the same country where they sell products. *If India, US and European Union block their Market against Chinese Companies or people started boycotting Chinese goods then China will be paralyzed.* *#BoycottChineseProduct**#*\n\n11. There were/are always allegations that Communist China is a Data theif. *They always probably trying to stole valuable data or technology from other country.* There is no democracy in China and Communist make people Robots. Means Chinese people have to Work, Think, Act as per communist party, they don't have independence. No one can ask question in China independently.\n\n12. *India had already banned 59 Chinese App. China had banned American App like Google, YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp etc but people are waiting to see strong action against Chinese bully by US & EU.* India, Australia, Japan will stand by US & EU. But unfortunately most of the big corporate of US & EU is operating from China. China do earn revenue from them and used the same money against US, EU, India, Australia, Japan etc. It's time to move out factories from China. Many believes China's biggest success is to loot US, EU and other countries.\n*Note : China has probably started a economic war & press some small countries to review deal with India, Japan, Australia, US etc...*\n\nAn appeal to all Youth of India & other parts of world, if all started to campaign against China, communist China will have taste their own medicine. Yes communist will use their paid propagandist, they could use huge money for propaganda but truth can't be hidden. But remember, War couldn't be won only by money or weapons, how much you love your country that is important.

For 100 tests per day a few weeks ago they used to have let's say 1 test coming back positive, now with 200 (2x more) tests they have roughly 4 (4x more)coming back positive. The *positivity rate* is clearly superior to the increase in testing, therefore an increase in the *positivity rate* indicates an increase in infections as science has figured out decades ago. Just like testing nor CNN are not responsible for the sharp increase in ICU admissions in Florida, Texas and Arizona and hospitalizations across the country. Fool educate yourself instead of jumping into fights with ignorant talking points without understanding the topic. Testing don't create cases, they reveal them. While here some fools take their cues from an ignorant con-man ex TV host, other countries like Canada, South Korea, Germany or the UK listen to experts and we understand why they're doing much better than us now.", "@rapdeath 22 No of course he's not, we're talking about positivity rate here. Meaning the number of tests comimg back positive. Let me try to simplify it for your stupid self as much as I can : if you test 100 people get 1 case, positivity rate is roughly 1% but if a few weeks later you start testing 200 people per day and find an average of 4 cases you understand that you only doubled your testing but you find 4 times more cases. The tests didn't create them fool. Scientists around the world have figured it out long time about an increase in positivity rate indicates an increase in infections. Period. The increase in hospitalizations in red states that reopened too early like Florida, Arizona and Texas is not created by testing. Shouldn't be that hard to comprehend dumbass if you were not listening to an incompetent con man ex reality TV host to get your medical advice. The rest of the world from Canada, Germany, the UK to Thailand and South Korea figured it out a while ago, here we still have fools debating if testing create cases. They don't.

It is therefore irrelevant to this discussion and serves no purpose other than to attempt to minimize the current debacle of a response in te US. \n    That being said you do know that they test for and treat both heart disease and Cancers right?

Engineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research : Nature News & Comment https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787.   NATURE | NEWS\nEngineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research\nLab-made coronavirus related to SARS can infect human cells.\nEditors\u2019 note, March 2020: We are aware that this story is being used as the basis for unverified theories that the novel coronavirus causing\nCOVID-19 was engineered. There is no evidence that this is true; scientists believe that an animal is the most likely source of the coronavirus.\n12 November 2015\nAn experiment that created a hybrid version of a bat coronavirus \u2014 one related to the virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)\n\u2014 has triggered renewed debate over whether engineering lab variants of viruses with possible pandemic potential is worth the risks.\nIn an article published in Nature Medicine1 on 9 November, scientists investigated a virus called SHC014, which is found in horseshoe bats in\nChina. The researchers created a chimaeric virus, made up of a surface protein of SHC014 and the backbone of a SARS virus that had been\nadapted to grow in mice and to mimic human disease. The chimaera infected human airway cells \u2014 proving that the surface protein of SHC014 has\nthe necessary structure to bind to a key receptor on the cells and to infect them. It also caused disease in mice, but did not kill them.\nAlthough almost all coronaviruses isolated from bats have not been able to bind to the key human receptor, SHC014 is not the first that can do so.\nIn 2013, researchers reported this ability for the first time in a different coronavirus isolated from the same bat population2. The findings reinforce suspicions that bat coronaviruses capable of directly infecting humans (rather than first\nneeding to evolve in an intermediate animal host) may be more common than previously thought, the researchers\nsay.\nBut other virologists question whether the information gleaned from the experiment justifies the potential risk.\nAlthough the extent of any risk is difficult to assess, Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in\nParis, points out that the researchers have created a novel virus that \u201cgrows remarkably well\u201d in human cells. \u201cIf\nDeclan Butler\nEngineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research : Nature News & Comment https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787\n1 of 4 3/30/2020, 3:07 AM\nthe virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory,\u201d he says. Biosafety in the balance\nCreation of a chimaera\nThe argument is essentially a rerun of the debate over whether to allow lab research that increases the virulence, ease of spread or host range of\ndangerous pathogens \u2014 what is known as \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 research. In October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal\nfunding of such research on the viruses that cause SARS, influenza and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome, a deadly disease caused by a\nvirus that sporadically jumps from camels to people).\nThe latest study was already under way before the US moratorium began, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) allowed it to proceed while\nit was under review by the agency, says Ralph Baric, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a co-author\nof the study. The NIH eventually concluded that the work was not so risky as to fall under the moratorium, he says.\nBut Wain-Hobson disapproves of the study because, he says, it provides little benefit, and reveals little about the risk that the wild SHC014 virus in\nbats poses to humans.\nOther experiments in the study show that the virus in wild bats would need to evolve to pose any threat to humans \u2014 a change that may never\nhappen, although it cannot be ruled out. Baric and his team reconstructed the wild virus from its genome sequence and found that it grew poorly in\nhuman cell cultures and caused no significant disease in mice.\n\u201cThe only impact of this work is the creation, in a lab, of a new, non-natural risk,\u201d agrees Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biodefence\nexpert at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Both Ebright and Wain-Hobson are long-standing critics of gain-of-function research.\nIn their paper, the study authors also concede that funders may think twice about allowing such experiments in the future. \"Scientific review panels\nmay deem similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating strains too risky to pursue,\" they write, adding that discussion is needed as\nto \"whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved\u201d.\nUseful research\nBut Baric and others say the research did have benefits. The study findings \u201cmove this virus from a candidate emerging pathogen to a clear and\npresent danger\u201d, says Peter Daszak, who co-authored the 2013 paper. Daszak is president of the EcoHealth Alliance, an international network of\nscientists, headquartered in New York City, that samples viruses from animals and people in emerging-diseases hotspots across the globe.\nEngineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research : Nature News & Comment https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787\n2 of 4 3/30/2020, 3:07 AM\nArticle PubMed ChemPort\nStudies testing hybrid viruses in human cell culture and animal models are limited in what they can say about the threat posed by a wild virus,\nDaszak agrees. But he argues that they can help indicate which pathogens should be prioritized for further research attention.\nWithout the experiments, says Baric, the SHC014 virus would still be seen as not a threat. Previously, scientists had believed, on the basis of\nmolecular modelling and other studies, that it should not be able to infect human cells. The latest work shows that the virus has already overcome\ncritical barriers, such as being able to latch onto human receptors and efficiently infect human airway cells, he says. \u201cI don't think you can ignore\nthat.\u201d He plans to do further studies with the virus in non-human primates, which may yield data more relevant to humans.\nNature doi:10.1038/nature.2015.18787\nTweet Follow @NatureNe"], "\"We are doing a great job\"!

He/She would NOT have tolerated attempt to gain patent monopolies by wasting months trying to reverse engineer the tests so they could maximize their profits on the tests.\n\nIn addition, the WHO, CDC, and DHS would have immediately deployed the resources to staff and reactivate the quarantine facilities that had been created by the Bush Administration after the 9/11 attack when there was fear of anthrax as well as other bio-terror weapons.  Given that these facilities were set up to control Hantavirus, Ebola, Avian Flu, Spanish Flu, and other known super-killers, Coronavirus would have been almost a holiday if Trump had acted immediately according to the Pandemic Response Plan passed from Bush to Obama then to Trump.\nIronically, one of the people who fought to have these FEMA Quarantine camps shut down was Susan Collins, who didn't want the \"death camps\" in her state.  It is true that the quarantine facilities were equipped to provide for save disposal of thousands of dead bodies that could be infectious and were therefore put in plastic hermetically sealed \"coffins\" that would prevent dead bodies from infecting the living.

In fact it was pretty tame.  Hell, earlier in that VERY same day Trump issued that light ban was the same day flights actually barred travel from those regions.\nSecond, I'm impressed that saved countless lives.  I guess all those current deaths are fake news and doesn't count?  But if you could, mind offering up proof that event saved lives and prevented COVID from rampaging across America.\nThird, I think you are referring to when Biden called rump xenophobic in a tweet just a few days after the flight ban.  Upon which he was just calling a pig just that.  There was no \"Because of the ban Trump is a racist.\"  remarks, or any other comments from Democratic political leaders.  (Self claimed democrats at your work or on comments are different and one cannot judge there.)\nFourth, most of Covid 19 cases are from the EU actually, so that just shows that Trump only pays attention to just the general basics.  Not the world view.  \nFifth, I really do hope you remember the time frame of when Pelosi and others who encouraged such acts happened.  This was done even before there was one case.  Trying not to scare America itself and such.  But once the cases arrived and the CDC was issuing warnings, then all types of endorsements like that dried up.   \nSixth, it's fun to see you blaming Pelosi about people going to Chinatown, when you have Trump actively pushing for rallies during a pandemic.  You have a president who is turning things into a political war such as \"Open schools or don't get funds.\"  You have a man in charge of the free world who is actively trying to downplay the virus to his base to sound strong.\nSeventh, I am a democrat.  I'm a bit active in the democratic party, at least for my town.  So I'd say I'm a bit higher than your average Joe and Jill Public.  And I have not seen ANY command from higher up or such about how we need to use this pandemic to fight against the impeached president.  Meanwhile Trump is the only one talking about how this pandemic is used to fight against him.  During a time of crisis he is using his political enemies to take the blame while not stepping up to combat the problem. \nEight, the very same people who are political critics and opponents are allied by scientists and CDC guidlines.

Patient zero has now been found, they traveled up from Melbourne, actually infected 3 co-workers & then all 4 of them attended that hotel on the 3rd for dinner. Virus has spread/been detected MUCH further now, covering around a 100km radius in all directions, with outbreaks in a gym, supermarkets, restaurants, clubs, casino etc. Genetic testing has confirmed it is the Melbourne form of the virus. Quite a changeling to contact trace this entire outbreak, but they're well into it & doing really well & look at this stage like they're going to pull it off. As a precaution though, all other states have closed their borders to anyone from Sydney until this is contained.

Numerous vaccines are currently in stage  trials, which means they're finished, final step being to confirm they work in the real world now that they're confirmed to work in labs & animal models & to be safe. What that means is that, if needed, stage 3 \"trials\" can in fact be giving the vaccine to millions of people in an area expected to be hard hit in around 6-8 weeks time. It's done, just needs that confirmation as to how effective it is, but again the animal & lab tests show clearly they work. Production is the only factor really slowing the roll out of the vaccine right now", "Exactly.

The airlines in particular will now see most of their staff having their wages paid by the government & their call centres & systems used as government health department & contact tracing resources. That gives the government the customer service trained people it needs for this job, along with the full call centre resources (physical, supervisors etc), while giving the companies the income support they need to stop them sacking employees due to the covid downturn in their industry. They're expected to be trained & come online in 4-6 weeks time ie when the Melbourne lockdown ends & restrictions ease & therefore the need for contact tracers to keep on top of this peaks. They will be supporting the existing contact tracers with follow up phone calls & other less critical tasks", "You can pretty much throw away contact tracing.", "@Lilac Lizard Wow.  Very informative", "And when you have no national infrastructure to combat the virus. That too. If we only had a pandemic response team who's job it would be to specifically protect us against the unchecked spread of a pandemic... hmmm. If only we had one of those things.", "Lots of misinformation about contact tracing, for anyone that wants to know how it works, here's how, using an example currently in tracing in Sydney Australia. Random 50 year old man gets tested for cold symptoms & tests positive. Downstream contact tracing is conducted, finding all close contacts he has had (15 minutes within 6 feet or 1 hour in the same room) starting 48 hours before he got symptoms & continuing up until the time of contact. 2 close contacts were identified, his parents that he lived with. They were advised they needed to home quarantine for 14 days & get tested for any symptoms. Both went on to develop symptoms & get tested, with results back yesterday that both had it. Contact tracing was carried out on them to discover they had zero contacts, since they had been contact traced & isolated before they became infectious. Virus chain successfully broken.\n\nMeanwhile a woman in her 30's in a similar area of the city got symptoms & got tested, again positive, downstream contacts traced & isolated, in one of these cases the contact wasn't caught in time & passed it on to 1 more person before they went into home quarantine, but all now caught & virus chain broken.\n\nOnce all downstream cases have been identified & contacted, contact tracers then focus on upstream contacts, going back 14 days before infection, to get details of all locations & people the infected person has come into contact with to try to identify who they caught it from. \n\nBoth these cases were identified as having had dinner at the same location on the same night. Since they were the only cases in Sydney in the last 3 weeks, there was a strong chance this location was therefore the source of the virus. It was a place called the \"crossroads hotel\" a major truckers hub where longhaul freight truckers stop for dinner. Given there's an outbreak in Melbourne, it was therefore a very likely match to where the 2 people had become infected, so contact tracers began focusing on it. \n\nNo immediate patient zero could be found, but this was a VERY high risk location to be involved in the spread, so the media was used to get the word out about possible infection there. The hotel was closed & a popup testing clinic put into it's carpark for the media to advertise & for any regulars who attempted to attend the hotel to find & be enticed to get tested. This testing clinic has so far found 10 direct infections from this hotel, with another 10 contacts of these people also infected & another 1 as the third generation infection I mentioned before. It is expected to grow significantly larger than this, with people from that location who have now tested positive having visited numerous other pubs & clubs in the area, so again all these have been publicised, with dates & times the infected people were there, so that anyone there at the same time can know that & watch for symptoms (see below).\n\nDue to the size of this cluster & one of the employees now testing positive too, anyone who attended between the 3rd & 10th of July has now been asked to home quarantine for 14 days from the last day they visited the hotel, while detailed contact tracing continues.\n\nAdditional to the media, all hotels here are required to keep lists of everyone who enters the premises for contact tracing purposes, so these lists are being used by contact tracers to contact everyone there & tell them they've been exposed & need to self quarantine. EVERYONE, regardless of symptoms, is being asked to get tested too if they attended this venue. Additional to the hotel list, there is also a mobile phone app in Australia that automates a lot of contact tracing. If both people are running it, then if they get within 6 feet of each other & stay there for 15 minutes, the phone app will log in an encrypted file on the users phone the app data from the other person's phone (their name/fake name, phone number & age range). Contact tracers can later request access to this data & if the phone owner gives permission, they have the software to unencrypted the data on the phone for contact tracing.\n\nSo far patient zero from the crossroads hotel has still not been found, but contact tracers are still working on it & as they go through all the hotel's records of visitors, with particular focus on truck drivers who had recently been in Melbourne, accessing trucking records to cross reference people at the hotel over the 14 days prior to the infections. They will hopefully find the person & will then be able to do more comprehensive downstream contact tracing, which could be really important if it is a long haul trucker, even if that person has recovered before found, as it will let them know areas of the country where they need to set up pop up testing clinics & focus on looking for hidden cases.\n\nSo that's how contact tracing works :)\n\n\nList of venues found so far that were visited by those infected at that hotel while infectious\n\n  \" The gaming room at the Picton Hotel on 4, 5, 9 and 10 July. The hotel has been closed for cleaning. A pop-up clinic will also be operational at Picton tomorrow at Victoria Park, Menangle Road from 8.30am- 6pm.\n    NSW Health is urging  people who were at the Picton Hotel on these days, especially those in the gaming room to also self-isolate for 14 days since they were last there, and to  attend a clinic for testing even if they have no symptoms, watch for symptoms and get retested should any respiratory symptoms occur. Even if you get a negative test stay in isolation for 14 days.\n     6 to 10 July Planet Fitness Casula\n    4 July Star City Casino 20:00\u2010 22:30hrs\n    4 July Canterbury Leagues Club 23:00\u2010 01:00hrs\n    6 July Narellan Town Centre shopping town Kmart, Target, Best & Less, H&M and food court\n    27 June Zone Bowling Villawood 11 am to 3 pm. \"\n\nThe aim is to catch every person that was at these venues either before they transmit or with minimal transmission & then isolating their contacts before they become infectious. If that can be done, the state of NSW will return to having eliminated the virus again - for now. With state borders closed, if all can be found, it should be possible to stay free of covid in NSW & all states outside Victoria, so returning the economy to normal. That's how contact tracing works & why it's so important", "agreed, no way contact tracing is possible with that many people, that's how you know a lockdown is needed to reduce numbers back to contact tracing capacity. Melbourne Australia has just hit that point, with 200 new cases a day & only 1,000 contact tracers in that state, plus another 1,000 from another 7 states added to their resources (so 8,000 total), plus army brought in to supplement the contact tracing effort. They are just managing to keep up with the contact tracing for those 200 new cases a day with those resourses, but the surrounding states are all enforcing very tight border closures, saying the contact tracing is completely inadequate for the job & cannot be trusted at all to have caught all contacts, so everyone in the state has to be assumed to be infected & not yet contact traced. \n\nThere's NO WAY you can adequately contact trace 15,000 cases a day! You would need to have over half a million highly trained & experienced people employed as contact tracers to pull that off, which you simply do not have & even if you did, the co-ordination needed to link the upstream cases would be impossible with that number of cases!

It goes like this:\n-Biden wins the popular vote, and carries the key swing states of Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by decent but not overwhelming margins.\r\n\r\n-Trump immediately declares that the voting was rigged, that there was mail-in ballot fraud and that the Chinese were behind a plan to provide fraudulent mail-in ballots and other \"election hacking\" throughout the four key swing states that gave Biden his victory.\r\n\r\n-Having railed against the Chinese throughout the campaign, calling Biden \"soft on China,\" Trump delivers his narrative claiming the Chinese have interfered in the U.S. election.\r\n\r\n-Trump indicates this is a major national security issue, and he invokes emergency powers, directing the Justice Department to investigate the alleged activity in the swing states. The legal justification for the presidential powers he invokes has already been developed and issued by Barr.\r\n\r\n-The investigation is intended to tick down the clock toward December 14, the deadline when each state's Electoral College electors must be appointed. This is the very issue that the Supreme Court harped on in Bush v. Gore in ruling that the election process had to be brought to a close, thus forbidding the further counting of Florida ballots.\r\n\r\n-All four swing states have Republican control of both their upper and lower houses of their state legislatures. Those state legislatures refuse to allow any Electoral College slate to be certified until the \"national security\" investigation is complete.\r\n\r\n-The Democrats will have begun a legal action to certify the results in those four states, and the appointment of the Biden slate of electors, arguing that Trump has manufactured a national security emergency in order to create the ensuing chaos.\r\n\r\n-The issue goes up to the Supreme Court, which unlike the 2000 election does not decide the election in favor of the Republicans. However, it indicates again that the December 14 Electoral College deadline must be met; that the president's national security powers legally authorize him to investigate potential foreign country intrusion into the national election; and if no Electoral College slate can be certified by any state by December 14, the Electoral College must meet anyway and cast its votes.\r\n\r\n-The Electoral College meets, and without the electors from those four states being represented, neither Biden nor Trump has sufficient votes to get an Electoral College majority.\r\n\r\n-The election is thrown into the House of Representatives, pursuant to the Constitution. Under the relevant constitutional process, the vote in the House is by state delegation, where each delegation casts one vote, which is determined by the majority of the representatives in that state.\r\n\r\n-Currently, there are 26 states that have a majority Republican House delegation. 23 states have a majority Democratic delegation. There is one state, Pennsylvania, that has an evenly split delegation. Even if the Democrats were to pick up seats in Pennsylvania and hold all their 2018 House gains, the Republicans would have a 26 to 24 delegation majority.\r\n\r\n-This vote would enable Trump to retain the presidency.", "@Paul Ferreira Really?......even if he did....NONE  were personally linked.", "No deaths reported here.

The functions of filopodia are broad in nature; they contribute to wound healing processes, adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), guidance toward chemoattractants, neuronal growth-cone path finding and embryonic development.\"\n\n\"Despite the vital role of filopodia in cell functions, the biological mechanisms that govern filopodial functions are not completely understood. Current studies have only scratched the surface of the numerous roles of filopodia, whether beneficial or pathogenic. An emerging example of filopodia functions in infectious diseases is the recent discovery of the role of filopodia in viral surfing during entry and trafficking.\"\n\nPictured: How Covid-19 hijacks human cells and causes them to sprout TENTACLES\nhttps://timesfamous.com/unitedstatesofamerica/pictured-how-covid-19-hijacks-human-cells-and-causes-them-to-sprout-tentacles/\n\n\"Columbia University microbiologist Professor Stephen Goff admitted the finding was \u2018intriguing\u2019 but said it did not necessarily mean the tentacles were behaving as a second mode of spreading.

We're not doing that,\" Krogan said. \"We're saying 'Let's understand the underlying biology behind how the virus infects us, and let's use that against the virus.' \"\n\n\"They also found that the virus has a dramatic effect on a pathway \u2014 a group of kinases that form a cascade a little like falling dominoes. The virus hijacks this cascade so that the end result becomes a dangerous overreaction by our immune system. \n======================\n\n(**Immune systems can overreact to vaccines as well.)\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/guides-pubs/downloads/vacc_mandates_chptr13.pdf pg 264\n\"Whether an adverse event that occurs after vaccination was caused by the vaccine or was  merely temporally related and caused by some totally independent (and often unknown or unidentified) factor is often difficult to ascertain.\"\n\nPg 273\n\"Although vaccines are safe and effective, they are neither perfectly safe nor perfectly  effective.  Some persons who receive vaccines will have an adverse reaction, and some will  not  be  protected.  In developing vaccines, the challenge is to minimize the likelihood of  adverse effect while maximizing effectiveness. Some people have medical conditions that  increase the risk for adverse effect, and therefore they should not receive vaccines.  Recognizing this fact, all state vaccination laws provide for exemptions for persons with  contraindicating conditions\"\n=======================\n\"The study's finding on this pathway may help to explain the extreme overreaction \u2014 a cytokine storm \u2014 that causes the immune system to kill both healthy and diseased tissue, leading to more than half of the deaths from COVID-19.\" \n\n(Is it from COVID-19 only or are there underlying conditions and if the latter why should COVID-19 be labeled as sole cause when it acts more as a catalyst that is potentially exploiting what is already there as mentioned above?

Covid 19 + bacterial infection = elevated procalcitonin. \"This is a test that you can do.\" - \n\n43:27 - The last thing you can do is check for these general markers of inflammation. What are some of these markers of inflammation? Again they're not specific but will help us in determining the patients mortality rate: Elevated CRP, ESR and IL-6 (Released from macrophages and liver as an acute phase reactive protein). Higher concentrations of LDH. Elevated D-Dimer and ferritin.\n\n44:50 - High mortality associated with elevated tropanine and CK-MB indicative of there not being enough profusion to the heart. (Speculative: Not a patient you would want to hook up to a ventilator! Elevated levels of the aforementioned may call for therapeutics that aim to reduce said levels so as to slow down the inflammation that is building up. More air pumped into the body without any means of mitigating the increase of said levels may perpetuate the elevation of same.) Consolidation of alveoli with signs of increased heart and respiration rate which may be indicative of hypoxemia. (14:27)*\n\n45:37 - Imaging techniques that can be utilized. (In cases where RT-PCR test negative or not enough for Doctor to feel confident enough in exercising their discretion) \"Generally you're going to want to start off with a chest x-ray but you're going to see that CT is actually the most sensitive test at this point in time for being able to determine if someone has covid-19. Now it is not specific meaning that there could be other infections. You can have influenza or viral pneumonia like influenza pneumonia or other different types like adenovirus (\"garden-variety\") they can present with actual findings on a CT scan very similar to covid-19 but again it is helpful because of high sensitivity over %95 for looking at covid-19.\"\nIf taken at face value and without question the language utilized by this educator seems to imply that certain tests are optional and are up to the discretion of the Doctor. That is to suggest that different doctors may exercise their discretion in different ways depending upon the resources that may or may not be available to them (i.e. Equipment: the time and money to afford them and whether they are covered by government and/or private insurance companies). Couple these factors with the fact that hospitals receive an incentive for diagnosing patients with covid-19 and more so when putting them on a ventilator (but not for any other of the garden-variety of pneumonia: https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/coronavirus-fact-check-hospitals-get-paid-more-if-patients-listed-as-covid-19-on-ventilators/ar-BB13k9pc), constant reporting by the media (that borderlines astroturfing) and you have the foundation for a consensus bias.\n\nIn Science, it is often the case that more information enables one to refine the results of what it is they are attempting to affirm or negate as true or false so as to minimize the level of uncertainty in any given analyses. If testing procedures differ per doctor/hospital whether that is due to a difference in discretion and/or resources that can be utilized then how can one trust the statistics that are reported given the lack of consistency in testing across the board? A common definition of what \"due diligence\" would entail is absolutely necessary for if test that can be done are not being done then it is possible that a patient can be misdiagnosed and the improper solution administered as a result. In this case we do not wish to assume malice of our professionals, although this is possible and would not be the first time (i.e. https://www.globalresearch.ca/monsanto-controls-both-the-white-house-and-the-us-congress/5336422 - \"Government appointment of Monsanto associates\"), but that they may have been pressured enough to jump onto the bandwagon of the consensus.\n\nThe media does not assist in the matter. Perpetuating the fear which drives everyone to visit a hospital regardless if there is capacity or not. Putting pressure on Doctors to perform tests that are time and cost effective so as to not hold up the line of patients waiting at the door. Especially if a test like the RT-PCR, for instance, per patient takes up to 5 or more hours! Patients would have to camp out in front of the hospitals to secure their place in line. Doctors would be working more overtime than ever since these tests take up more than half if not their entire shift. What a disposition to be in! One has to wonder if the statistics would be different if all methods mentioned were implemented per patient.\n\nOther factors to consider:\nAstroturf and manipulation of media messages | Sharyl Attkisson | TEDxUniversityofNevada\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bYAQ-ZZtEU\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/harvard-professor-charged-with-hiding-china-ties\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800442646/acclaimed-harvard-scientist-is-arrested-accused-of-lying-about-ties-to-china\n\n\"Zaosong Zheng, 30, was arrested last month at Boston's Logan International Airport and is charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle vials of biological materials and other research materials stolen from U.S labs.\"\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/harvard-university-professor-and-two-chinese-nationals-charged-three-separate-china-related\n\nCorrelation causation? \"Factcheck.org\" says NO! \nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/no-link-between-harvard-scientist-charles-lieber-and-coronavirus/\n\nCDC passing off theoreticals as absolutes regarding herd immunity that they deem can be solely achieved via vaccination?\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/guides-pubs/downloads/vacc_mandates_chptr13.pdf\n\nPg 264 -265\n\"When a community has a high level of vaccination, an individual might decide to not be vaccinated to avoid the small risk for adverse events while benefitting from the  vaccination  of  others.

The functions of filopodia are broad in nature; they contribute to wound healing processes, adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), guidance toward chemoattractants, neuronal growth-cone path finding and embryonic development.\"\n\n\"Despite the vital role of filopodia in cell functions, the biological mechanisms that govern filopodial functions are not completely understood. Current studies have only scratched the surface of the numerous roles of filopodia, whether beneficial or pathogenic. An emerging example of filopodia functions in infectious diseases is the recent discovery of the role of filopodia in viral surfing during entry and trafficking.\"\n\nPictured: How Covid-19 hijacks human cells and causes them to sprout TENTACLES\nhttps://timesfamous.com/unitedstatesofamerica/pictured-how-covid-19-hijacks-human-cells-and-causes-them-to-sprout-tentacles/\n\"Columbia University microbiologist Professor Stephen Goff admitted the finding was \u2018intriguing\u2019 but said it did not necessarily mean the tentacles were behaving as a second mode of spreading. He told the LA Times: \u2018It\u2019s intriguing and a really cool observation. But we don\u2019t yet know what stage [of infection] is affected. It will be great fun to find out.\"\n\nStudy reveals images of the coronavirus forming tentacles in cells -- but monstrous discovery helps identify new treatment\nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/06/26/coronavirus-grows-tentacles-inside-cells-providing-clue-treatment/3235414001/\n\n\"Many scientists have been screening thousands of drugs already approved for other uses to determine if they can also be used to treat COVID-19. We're not doing that,\" Krogan said. \"We're saying 'Let's understand the underlying biology behind how the virus infects us, and let's use that against the virus.' \"\n\n\"They also found that the virus has a dramatic effect on a pathway \u2014 a group of kinases that form a cascade a little like falling dominoes. The virus hijacks this cascade so that the end result becomes a dangerous overreaction by our immune system. \n======================\n(**Immune systems can overreact to vaccines as well.)\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/guides-pubs/downloads/vacc_mandates_chptr13.pdf pg 264\n\"Whether an adverse event that occurs after vaccination was caused by the vaccine or was  merely temporally related and caused by some totally independent (and often unknown or unidentified) factor is often difficult to ascertain.\"\n\nPg 273\n\"Although vaccines are safe and effective, they are neither perfectly safe nor perfectly  effective.  Some persons who receive vaccines will have an adverse reaction, and some will  not  be  protected.  In developing vaccines, the challenge is to minimize the likelihood of  adverse effect while maximizing effectiveness.

Time and money!\n\n37:05 - Rule out Influenza A and B. (Nasal/oral swab): 38:08 - \"Let's say that that comes back negative. It's not the flu. Doesn't mean that it's not the flu. But again the suspicion is high for the coronavirus because they have a super high fever.\"\n\n33:44 - RT-PCR tests. Takes approximately 5 hours or more (per patient!) \"sensitivity from 30% - 80% and they take a lot of time!\" \n\n34:05 \"...you run this test right away, sure. But you might not get the results back in time when you need them and on top of that their sensitivity isn't really that great (doxa?). Sputum, aspirate, blood or swab to test.\n\n39:40 - NAAT test - \"It is expensive.\" - \"Up to $300\"\n\n40:30 - Bloodwork. \"Order a CBC and CMP. We can also, if we want to, check specific markers that have been associated with a high mortality rates with this disease.\"\n\n40:40 - Check CBC. \"CBC is going to tell us our white blood cell count, red cell count and our platelets right? And then we can get a diff(?). What we're going to see here with this and this is what is super interesting, you see what is called \"Lymphopenia\". %80 or more of the time you see Lymphopenia. That is really odd. Because what would you expect if someone is having an infection you would expect a high white count. But again you're going to see more commonly Lymphopenia.\"\n\n41:18 - Signs of organ failure(s) and checking for proper profusion to kidneys\n\n ***(Very important!!! See why below.) 42:26 - Check for a molecule called \"procalcitonin\" particular to bacterial infections. Levels will be normal if primarily covid-19. Covid 19 + bacterial infection = elevated procalcitonin. \"This is a test that you can do.\" - \n\n43:27 - The last thing you can do is check for these general markers of inflammation. What are some of these markers of inflammation? Again they're not specific but will help us in determining the patients mortality rate: Elevated CRP, ESR and IL-6 (Released from macrophages and liver as an acute phase reactive protein). Higher concentrations of LDH. Elevated D-Dimer and ferritin.\n\n44:50 - High mortality associated with elevated tropanine and CK-MB indicative of there not being enough profusion to the heart. (Speculative: Not a patient you would want to hook up to a ventilator! Elevated levels of the aforementioned may call for therapeutics that aim to reduce said levels so as to slow down the inflammation that is building up. More air pumped into the body without any means of mitigating the increase of said levels may perpetuate the elevation of same.) Consolidation of alveoli with signs of increased heart and respiration rate which may be indicative of hypoxemia. (14:27)*\n\n45:37 - Imaging techniques that can be utilized. (In cases where RT-PCR test negative or not enough for Doctor to feel confident enough in exercising their discretion) \"Generally you're going to want to start off with a chest x-ray but you're going to see that CT is actually the most sensitive test at this point in time for being able to determine if someone has covid-19. Now it is not specific meaning that there could be other infections. You can have influenza or viral pneumonia like influenza pneumonia or other different types like adenovirus (\"garden-variety\") they can present with actual findings on a CT scan very similar to covid-19 but again it is helpful because of high sensitivity over %95 for looking at covid-19.\"\nIf taken at face value and without question the language utilized by this educator seems to imply that certain tests are optional and are up to the discretion of the Doctor. That is to suggest that different doctors may exercise their discretion in different ways depending upon the resources that may or may not be available to them (i.e. Equipment: the time and money to afford them and whether they are covered by government and/or private insurance companies). Couple these factors with the fact that hospitals receive an incentive for diagnosing patients with covid-19 and more so when putting them on a ventilator (but not for any other of the garden-variety of pneumonia: https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/coronavirus-fact-check-hospitals-get-paid-more-if-patients-listed-as-covid-19-on-ventilators/ar-BB13k9pc), constant reporting by the media (that borderlines astroturfing) and you have the foundation for a consensus bias.\n\nIn Science, it is often the case that more information enables one to refine the results of what it is they are attempting to affirm or negate as true or false so as to minimize the level of uncertainty in any given analyses. If testing procedures differ per doctor/hospital whether that is due to a difference in discretion and/or resources that can be utilized then how can one trust the statistics that are reported given the lack of consistency in testing across the board? A common definition of what \"due diligence\" would entail is absolutely necessary for if test that can be done are not being done then it is possible that a patient can be misdiagnosed and the improper solution administered as a result. In this case we do not wish to assume malice of our professionals, although this is possible and would not be the first time (i.e. https://www.globalresearch.ca/monsanto-controls-both-the-white-house-and-the-us-congress/5336422 - \"Government appointment of Monsanto associates\"), but that they may have been pressured enough to jump onto the bandwagon of the consensus.\n\nThe media does not assist in the matter. Perpetuating the fear which drives everyone to visit a hospital regardless if there is capacity or not. Putting pressure on Doctors to perform tests that are time and cost effective so as to not hold up the line of patients waiting at the door. Especially if a test like the RT-PCR, for instance, per patient takes up to 5 or more hours! Patients would have to camp out in front of the hospitals to secure their place in line. Doctors would be working more overtime than ever since these tests take up more than half if not their entire shift. What a disposition to be in! One has to wonder if the statistics would be different if all methods mentioned were implemented per patient.\n\nOther factors to consider:\nAstroturf and manipulation of media messages | Sharyl Attkisson | TEDxUniversityofNevada\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bYAQ-ZZtEU\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/harvard-professor-charged-with-hiding-china-ties\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800442646/acclaimed-harvard-scientist-is-arrested-accused-of-lying-about-ties-to-china\n\n\"Zaosong Zheng, 30, was arrested last month at Boston's Logan International Airport and is charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle vials of biological materials and other research materials stolen from U.S labs.\"\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/harvard-university-professor-and-two-chinese-nationals-charged-three-separate-china-related\n\nCorrelation causation? \"Factcheck.org\" says NO! \nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/no-link-between-harvard-scientist-charles-lieber-and-coronavirus/\n\nCDC passing off theoreticals as absolutes regarding herd immunity that they deem can be solely achieved via vaccination?\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/guides-pubs/downloads/vacc_mandates_chptr13.pdf\n\nPg 264 -265\n\"When a community has a high level of vaccination, an individual might decide to not be vaccinated to avoid the small risk for adverse events while benefitting from the  vaccination  of  others.

There is no one, uniform approach that we can take - or should take - nationwide.\"  At this time, parents still hold the right and freedom to homeschool their children, an approach that is advocated by Betsy DeVos.  Students in the public school system are typically followed by their allotted money...meaning, that when the student attends public school, the school receives a set amount of money per day.  This is why schools (and mayors, apparently...San Francisco...) are adament that students attend as much as possible: attendance = money for the school.  Public charter schools that have homeschool options, give a portion of the money allotted for the student to the parent to order parent-selected curriculu, books, enrichment material, and extra-curricular classes/activities.  It is cheaper for the government to have students homeschool than it is to have students attend \"brick and mortar\" schools.  In addition, homeschooling gives students/families the flexibility to select curriculum and enrichment materials that cater to each student's individual needs and talents which results in a tailored education (think tailed suit versus rental suit...which fits best?).  If parents are uncomfortable with sending their children to a fulltime, brick and mortar public school this fall, they have the right and freedom to opt to homeschool their children.  There is a growing homeschool community in the U.S. with a growing number of options and curricula for the vast variety of students.  This right and freedom of parents and students is under attack by the left/liberals.

If so, please do so but include facts as I have plenty and will challenge your thinking, reasoning, logic and opinions quite hard if you are not prepared.  I recommend that before you contemplate responding you review many of the facts I posted in this chat group that confirm no pandemic exists today. \n\nThere is a virus but it is not a pandemic.  As I posted in an earlier response, the death rate as of March (peak) was 0.31% in line with a common flu.  The death rates are now declining despite cases increasing (https://outkick.com/media-ignores-deaths-dropping-by-90-new-coronavirus-death-low-since-april-21/). Before you assume that\u2019s because death rates follow two to four weeks later, the most recent studies already account for that. The MSM only focuses on infections and not on death rates which is a key metric to confirm a pandemic. \n\nPlease do research, which takes effort. Don\u2019t repeat what is being presented to you by CNN as that is lazy and ignorant. The only logical reasons I see for you to believe CNN is a source of truth are 1) you work for the network (benefit of the doubt) or 2) you\u2019ve reached Stockholm syndrome levels.  If your issue is the first, then I hope you can learn from the information I provided as it is my intent to help educate people like you who are so driven by fear due to false repetition of existential threat by the MSM.  However, if it is the second, then you must be in complete panic given that you are unable to see any facts and for that I feel sorry for you and those around you.  It must be a horrible way to live. \n\nSince I believe you\u2019ve reached Stockholm syndrome levels and I see no hope that you\u2019ll be able to snap out of it on your own, then the best I can do is wish you good luck in life.  Lastly, I\u2019d like to give you a word of advice for your own good.

Engineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research : Nature News & Comment https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787.   NATURE | NEWS\nEngineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research\nLab-made coronavirus related to SARS can infect human cells.\nEditors\u2019 note, March 2020: We are aware that this story is being used as the basis for unverified theories that the novel coronavirus causing\nCOVID-19 was engineered. There is no evidence that this is true; scientists believe that an animal is the most likely source of the coronavirus.\n12 November 2015\nAn experiment that created a hybrid version of a bat coronavirus \u2014 one related to the virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)\n\u2014 has triggered renewed debate over whether engineering lab variants of viruses with possible pandemic potential is worth the risks.\nIn an article published in Nature Medicine1 on 9 November, scientists investigated a virus called SHC014, which is found in horseshoe bats in\nChina. The researchers created a chimaeric virus, made up of a surface protein of SHC014 and the backbone of a SARS virus that had been\nadapted to grow in mice and to mimic human disease. The chimaera infected human airway cells \u2014 proving that the surface protein of SHC014 has\nthe necessary structure to bind to a key receptor on the cells and to infect them. It also caused disease in mice, but did not kill them.\nAlthough almost all coronaviruses isolated from bats have not been able to bind to the key human receptor, SHC014 is not the first that can do so.\nIn 2013, researchers reported this ability for the first time in a different coronavirus isolated from the same bat population2. The findings reinforce suspicions that bat coronaviruses capable of directly infecting humans (rather than first\nneeding to evolve in an intermediate animal host) may be more common than previously thought, the researchers\nsay.\nBut other virologists question whether the information gleaned from the experiment justifies the potential risk.\nAlthough the extent of any risk is difficult to assess, Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in\nParis, points out that the researchers have created a novel virus that \u201cgrows remarkably well\u201d in human cells. \u201cIf\nDeclan Butler\nEngineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research : Nature News & Comment https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787\n1 of 4 3/30/2020, 3:07 AM\nthe virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory,\u201d he says. Biosafety in the balance\nCreation of a chimaera\nThe argument is essentially a rerun of the debate over whether to allow lab research that increases the virulence, ease of spread or host range of\ndangerous pathogens \u2014 what is known as \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 research. In October 2014, the US government imposed a moratorium on federal\nfunding of such research on the viruses that cause SARS, influenza and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome, a deadly disease caused by a\nvirus that sporadically jumps from camels to people).\nThe latest study was already under way before the US moratorium began, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) allowed it to proceed while\nit was under review by the agency, says Ralph Baric, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a co-author\nof the study. The NIH eventually concluded that the work was not so risky as to fall under the moratorium, he says.\nBut Wain-Hobson disapproves of the study because, he says, it provides little benefit, and reveals little about the risk that the wild SHC014 virus in\nbats poses to humans.\nOther experiments in the study show that the virus in wild bats would need to evolve to pose any threat to humans \u2014 a change that may never\nhappen, although it cannot be ruled out. Baric and his team reconstructed the wild virus from its genome sequence and found that it grew poorly in\nhuman cell cultures and caused no significant disease in mice.\n\u201cThe only impact of this work is the creation, in a lab, of a new, non-natural risk,\u201d agrees Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biodefence\nexpert at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Both Ebright and Wain-Hobson are long-standing critics of gain-of-function research.\nIn their paper, the study authors also concede that funders may think twice about allowing such experiments in the future. \"Scientific review panels\nmay deem similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating strains too risky to pursue,\" they write, adding that discussion is needed as\nto \"whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved\u201d.\nUseful research\nBut Baric and others say the research did have benefits. The study findings \u201cmove this virus from a candidate emerging pathogen to a clear and\npresent danger\u201d, says Peter Daszak, who co-authored the 2013 paper. Daszak is president of the EcoHealth Alliance, an international network of\nscientists, headquartered in New York City, that samples viruses from animals and people in emerging-diseases hotspots across the globe.\nEngineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research : Nature News & Comment https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787\n2 of 4 3/30/2020, 3:07 AM\nArticle PubMed ChemPort\nStudies testing hybrid viruses in human cell culture and animal models are limited in what they can say about the threat posed by a wild virus,\nDaszak agrees. But he argues that they can help indicate which pathogens should be prioritized for further research attention.\nWithout the experiments, says Baric, the SHC014 virus would still be seen as not a threat. Previously, scientists had believed, on the basis of\nmolecular modelling and other studies, that it should not be able to infect human cells. The latest work shows that the virus has already overcome\ncritical barriers, such as being able to latch onto human receptors and efficiently infect human airway cells, he says. \u201cI don't think you can ignore\nthat.\u201d He plans to do further studies with the virus in non-human primates, which may yield data more relevant to humans.\nNature doi:10.1038/nature.2015.18787\nTweet Follow @NatureNe", "They are waiting for you all to line up for the VACCINE.

If you have the patience.... I'd appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective.\n\nConstitutional Law in and of itself is difficult for those who aren't lifelong students of it; and I don't consider any viable solutions will come from simple answers, but I've been to countries with actual tyranny.... but the divisiveness in this nation is a security risk; and it is why Russian & Chinese state owned media networks are using influence operations for the sake of destabilization.\n\n....but my analysis is based on academics and experience; after my time in the military, I then worked in the field of international relations and human rights for 13 years before becoming a pastor.\n\nThere is a reason many service members and veterans can't support Trump. For many of the same reasons we couldn't support Obama; and that is because the oath of enlistment has no expiration date, and we are in deeply troubling times.\n\nAnd although Trump cabinet is a cherry picked group of unqualified sycophants, whom even Trump himself can't stop contradicting and lying to....\nAnd despite dismantling the Office of Congressional Ethics in his first week as President, which caused an increased cesspool within both political parties; a handful of Representatives from each side are  maintaining some semblance of sanity, while our institutions are crumbling.\n\nIt seems like no matter how people vote.... it will be Alzheimers 2020. We as Americans deserve better options than the geriatric oligarchs presented to us by either party! As a  Veteran  I must say.... The language of \"loyalty\" to a political party is deeply disturbing, and disconcerting. Civvies are standing by while people die overseas for what they refuse to defend at home. We are Americans first, and not who we vote for.\n\nI would like to take the opportunity to share my thoughts with anyone who is interested; it would mean a lot to this  Veteran  if you consider reading what I put the time and effort into typing. Think of it as a way of thanking me for my service; it is my way of sharing my perspective with fellow Americans, veteran and civilian alike.... regardless of political affiliation.\n\nI know I'm not the only one getting tired of all of the foolishness/divisiveness in our Nation; the only left or right that matters, are those that will inevitably man the line, the next time our sons and daughters are drafted. And although people should be livid, we as Americans are finally getting sick of how candidates, regardless of party affiliation, have been disrespectful towards the people they are responsible to:\n\n1) Debates should be un-timed and uninterrupted \n\n2) Candidates should be required to fully elucidate their thoughts and policies\n\n3)  Panels of academics should be asking questions... not puppets with ear pieces\n\n4) Debates should go on as long as they have to\n\nBut Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS), goes both ways; either people think he is the antichrist, or idolize him to the point where they think he can do no wrong. Trump will probably get 2020; but that's to be expected, the US seldom has one term presidencies... regardless of how bad they are. \n\nNevertheless, that will be 4 more years of irreparable harm to America's standing in the world; estranging our relationships with longtime allies, who are existential to our existence.... while continuing to allow our would be  enemies to gain strength as Trump oddly worships tyrannical despots publicly. He is inept to the task at hand, as are many of the candidates presented.\n\nTrump views things as business deals, even when they're not; and is incapable of differentiating his personal affairs with matters of diplomacy. However, one cannot \"deal\" with tyrants like Russia & China; as they are flagrantly violating the Law of the Sea, the Geneva Accords, Flooding the world with drugs and weapons, and undermining sanctions on hostile nations around the world. Trump's failure to understand geopolitics, implement International Law as a tool, and be diplomatic is detrimental. He has on many occasions let his personality get in the way.\n\nFurthermore, he doesn't trust the intelligence community, or those who have spent their whole lives in the service & defense of our country; his own handpicked people, even. He believes he knows better than specialists in every respective field. Never mind the multitude of his weirdly unqualified cabinet choices. \n\nPeople focus too much on his personality and that, objectively, he's a national embarrassment; but as a veteran, I've found multiple reasons why he is a national security risk.\n\nIt shouldn't be abnormal to expect that we would be led by the best and brightest; have candidates capable of meeting the full spectrum of requisites for the performance of their office, and do so in a manner that is beyond aspersions or reproach. The people who write laws shouldn't be the ones who vote on them... we need people who can meet the needs of the modern day; people with multiple PhDs, real-world experience, and are  mentally/emotionally competent enough to listen to wise counsel without letting logical fallacies or cognitive biases come in conflict with sound reason.\n\nAnd since 9/11 each presidency & congressional house has made sweeping power grabs in direct conflict with the Constitution. And the political pendulum keeps swinging further left and right. I swore an oath to defend the Constitution... both foreign and domestic; but it seems that people at home have forgotten how fragile Democracy is, and it's deeply disturbing how things have been going, because when Democracy  fails.... tyranny prevails.\n\nWe as Americans have been complacent as both parties have become cartels, and very much two sides of the same coin.\n\nI would never want to see something like 9/11 on American soil ever again; but the unity it created following 9/12, made America temporarily more unified and the world a safer place.... at the expense and forfeitures of many freedoms domestically. And I know there's a whole culture of being \"woke\"; but the American Dream necessitates a certain degree of sleep. If people truly want to be woke.... they would enlist instead of sleepwalking through life.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFour things can help heal our country:\n1) Talk to people you have nothing in common with. \n\n2) Read \"On Tyranny\" by Timothy Snyder.... & \"The True Believer\" by Eric Hoffer.\n\n3) Take a little time every once in a while to watch C-SPAN, to see and hear exactly what our elected representatives are actually saying and doing.\n\n4) Demand an end to computational gerrymandering and reverse Citizens United.... to eliminate foreign influences on our Democracy.\n\nHere are some tools every American should know and use:\nhttps://www.hrw.org/united-states\nwww.MuckRock.com\nwww.EFF.org\nwww.314ACTION.org\nwww.FeedingAmerica.org\nhttps://supreme.justia.com", "We just watched you burn down your cities while killing cops and shooting children.

I'm in Europe as well and I'm horrified to see how many of us are agreeing with this a president. These conspiracy theories seem to very tempting in these scary times. So let's not get step on a moral high ground.  Furthermore, I believe that the sins of the fathers should not be visited upon the sons. Furthermore, you might want to do some  revision on your knowledge of American History because you think only the English sailed on the Mayflower or laid claim on the US then you are mistaken. The French, Spanish, Dutch etc also played their part and caused wars when the Republic was young. Where I do agree on is that racism/discrimination of some kind has always has been an issue. But let's not pretend that isn't/ hasn't been an issue in Europe and still is. We've also witness the systematic killing of a groups of people in Europe even in recent years.        What worries me is that this President tells obvious lies, pardons friends that clearly broken the laws and organises mass gatherings etc. The very least you would expect a President to do is to have some consideration for the people he pledged to serve. His ''leadership'' has lead to the highest number of preventable casualties and counting in the Western world. He appears to be very good at dividing people at time when a consensus of handling a very dangerous epidemic is doing it's rounds.

If you have the patience.... I'd appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective.\n\nConstitutional Law in and of itself is difficult for those who aren't lifelong students of it; and I don't consider any viable solutions will come from simple answers, but I've been to countries with actual tyranny.... but the divisiveness in this nation is a security risk; and it is why Russian & Chinese state owned media networks are using influence operations for the sake of destabilization.\n\n....but my analysis is based on academics and experience; after my time in the military, I then worked in the field of international relations and human rights for 13 years before becoming a pastor.\n\nThere is a reason many service members and veterans can't support Trump. For many of the same reasons we couldn't support Obama; and that is because the oath of enlistment has no expiration date, and we are in deeply troubling times.\n\nAnd although Trump cabinet is a cherry picked group of unqualified sycophants, whom even Trump himself can't stop contradicting and lying to....\nAnd despite dismantling the Office of Congressional Ethics in his first week as President, which caused an increased cesspool within both political parties; a handful of Representatives from each side are  maintaining some semblance of sanity, while our institutions are crumbling.\n\nIt seems like no matter how people vote.... it will be Alzheimers 2020. We as Americans deserve better options than the geriatric oligarchs presented to us by either party! As a  Veteran  I must say.... The language of \"loyalty\" to a political party is deeply disturbing, and disconcerting. Civvies are standing by while people die overseas for what they refuse to defend at home. We are Americans first, and not who we vote for.\n\nI would like to take the opportunity to share my thoughts with anyone who is interested; it would mean a lot to this  Veteran  if you consider reading what I put the time and effort into typing. Think of it as a way of thanking me for my service; it is my way of sharing my perspective with fellow Americans, veteran and civilian alike.... regardless of political affiliation.\n\nI know I'm not the only one getting tired of all of the foolishness/divisiveness in our Nation; the only left or right that matters, are those that will inevitably man the line, the next time our sons and daughters are drafted. And although people should be livid, we as Americans are finally getting sick of how candidates, regardless of party affiliation, have been disrespectful towards the people they are responsible to:\n\n1) Debates should be un-timed and uninterrupted \n\n2) Candidates should be required to fully elucidate their thoughts and policies\n\n3)  Panels of academics should be asking questions... not puppets with ear pieces\n\n4) Debates should go on as long as they have to\n\nBut Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS), goes both ways; either people think he is the antichrist, or idolize him to the point where they think he can do no wrong. Trump will probably get 2020; but that's to be expected, the US seldom has one term presidencies... regardless of how bad they are. \n\nNevertheless, that will be 4 more years of irreparable harm to America's standing in the world; estranging our relationships with longtime allies, who are existential to our existence.... while continuing to allow our would be  enemies to gain strength as Trump oddly worships tyrannical despots publicly. He is inept to the task at hand, as are many of the candidates presented.\n\nTrump views things as business deals, even when they're not; and is incapable of differentiating his personal affairs with matters of diplomacy. However, one cannot \"deal\" with tyrants like Russia & China; as they are flagrantly violating the Law of the Sea, the Geneva Accords, Flooding the world with drugs and weapons, and undermining sanctions on hostile nations around the world. Trump's failure to understand geopolitics, implement International Law as a tool, and be diplomatic is detrimental. He has on many occasions let his personality get in the way.\n\nFurthermore, he doesn't trust the intelligence community, or those who have spent their whole lives in the service & defense of our country; his own handpicked people, even. He believes he knows better than specialists in every respective field. Never mind the multitude of his weirdly unqualified cabinet choices. \n\nPeople focus too much on his personality and that, objectively, he's a national embarrassment; but as a veteran, I've found multiple reasons why he is a national security risk.\n\nIt shouldn't be abnormal to expect that we would be led by the best and brightest; have candidates capable of meeting the full spectrum of requisites for the performance of their office, and do so in a manner that is beyond aspersions or reproach. The people who write laws shouldn't be the ones who vote on them... we need people who can meet the needs of the modern day; people with multiple PhDs, real-world experience, and are  mentally/emotionally competent enough to listen to wise counsel without letting logical fallacies or cognitive biases come in conflict with sound reason.\n\nAnd since 9/11 each presidency & congressional house has made sweeping power grabs in direct conflict with the Constitution. And the political pendulum keeps swinging further left and right. I swore an oath to defend the Constitution... both foreign and domestic; but it seems that people at home have forgotten how fragile Democracy is, and it's deeply disturbing how things have been going, because when Democracy  fails.... tyranny prevails.\n\nWe as Americans have been complacent as both parties have become cartels, and very much two sides of the same coin.\n\nI would never want to see something like 9/11 on American soil ever again; but the unity it created following 9/12, made America temporarily more unified and the world a safer place.... at the expense and forfeitures of many freedoms domestically. And I know there's a whole culture of being \"woke\"; but the American Dream necessitates a certain degree of sleep. If people truly want to be woke.... they would enlist instead of sleepwalking through life.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFour things can help heal our country:\n1) Talk to people you have nothing in common with. \n\n2) Read \"On Tyranny\" by Timothy Snyder.... & \"The True Believer\" by Eric Hoffer.\n\n3) Take a little time every once in a while to watch C-SPAN, to see and hear exactly what our elected representatives are actually saying and doing.\n\n4) Demand an end to computational gerrymandering and reverse Citizens United.... to eliminate foreign influences on our Democracy.\n\nHere are some tools every American should know and use:\nhttps://www.hrw.org/united-states\nwww.MuckRock.com\nwww.EFF.org\nwww.314ACTION.org\nwww.FeedingAmerica.org\nhttps://supreme.justia.com", "b16d4ddy55 really?

Just helping you with facts to help you see there is no existential threat as the media has made everyone believed. What CNN and mainstream media are doing to inject fear onto the population is criminal, wrong and immoral. \n\nDo not accept sound bites as truth. Notice the media, WHO and government only focus on infections but never on the % of recoveries which is over 93%. Infection to fatality is a low 0.31% and exposure to fatality is a mere 0.10% (properly aligned between time of infection and deaths and excludes deaths \u201cwith\u201d COVID vs \u201cby\u201d COVID). These numbers are in line with those of the common flu. The masks can actually make you sick from lack of proper oxygen, inhalation of carbon dioxide (yours) and accumulated bacteria which all will lower your immune system. Moreover, the entire push for masks, contact tracing, social distancing (dividing families and relationships) and closure of the economy v\u00eda lockdowns is certainly not justifiable given the true facts.  Hence, you should ask yourself who benefits from pushing this extreme agenda/propaganda of fear which is evident by the fact that we are constantly bombarded with news of existential threat 24x7.  \n\nUnderstanding the facts requires effort via research whereas simply accepting what is being told by the media is plain ignorance and laziness.  Be inquisitive and search the truth to confirm the story lines told by the media. Don\u2019t live in unjustified fear. \n\nHere are a few links with facts for your reference.

Many Canadians no longer feel comfortable spending substantial periods of time in certain states because political discussion is unavoidable no matter how many times one tries to change the subject.    I am speaking anecdotally of course but  supper parties used to have spirited reasonable discourse between conflicting views which would end amicably.   Now we (10-12) people set ground rules that one cannot discuss politics or religion , which is a shame amongst people who have known each other for 20 years.   Canadians have differing views, Liberal, ,Conservative , and NDP(which could be loosely labelled as progressive socialism)   but politics is in the background of day to day life, and not a continuous stream of antagonist loudly daily expressed views.   I have many local friends in Florida and feel like it has become an ideological battleground.  It feels like a minefield, not a vacation.  My Asian friends no longer visit the US and go to Europe instead or other parts of Canada.    I spent a couple of months in Italy and Spain last fall and was shocked to hear open anti- American sentiment on display often.   I mourn the loss of the goodwill once enjoyed by the US as I used to feel very comfortable there.   I live in Toronto and we always welcomed and enjoyed US visitors who would come to TIFF,  sporting events, concerts, festivals , Niagara and other parts.

In 1789, when our Constitution was created, freedom of speech meant being able to stand on \"soap box\" in your town square and say what you want to local residents.   However, in today's Internet Era that same concept allows you not only to express your opinion locally but to potentially millions of people worldwide in an instant.  In 1789, expressing blatantly false information could only affect local residents, while today it allows to the whole of America and even the whole world to be influenced by a blatant lie almost instantly.  Commentator Gore Vidal noted that the First Amendment protects not only telling the truth, but it also protects someone who knowingly tells a lie as well.  He pointed out that the First Amendment says nothing about whether the speech being protected needs to be truthful at all.  In today's Internet Era, such a lack of specificity in the First Amendment allows LIARS to spread their LIES in an instant to millions of people, even derailing America today from knowing the TRUTH about COVID-19.  I have no problem with freedom of speech that allows the expression of Facts, but in the Internet Era it is STUPID to actually consider Outright LYING as \"protected speech\".  I would submit to you that a Democracy in the 21st Century that considers LYING to be \"protected speech\" is NO Democracy at all.  It allows a small number of people to spread a LIE like a pandemic itself, infecting the whole collective with falsehoods.  What value is there in casting a vote in such a Democracy when a voter's choice at the polls can be easily swayed by Lies that have NO Connection with the Reality at hand ?

So they make rules for their country, or state, or school, or whatever, based on a lie that they actually think is real because their afraid of liability, backlash, getting sick etc, even if its nonsense.

The Bill Gates thing is too much to get into, but here's some:  He admits to wanting to kill off large amounts of people with his vaccines.  And that's based on an actual quote from one of his talks and besides the fact that eugenicism is inherently murderous, which is his belief system.  He also wants to profit from those vaccines.

This time, according to an FBI investigation, it has been revealed that none other than Adam Schiff was a close associate of Jeffrey Epstein.\r\n\r\nLast month, Attorney General, Bill Barr, launched an investigation into his political rivals, the Democrats. The investigation focuses mainly on the impeachment Democrats, namely Adam Schiff. The results of this investigation was troubling, to say the least.\r\n\r\nA treasure trove of emails was found on Hillary\u2018s private email server. Among these emails were 256 between Adam Schiff and Epstein. The contents of these emails discussed trips to Epstein Isle and other things too vile to mention.\r\n\r\nBelow is an excerpt of the FBI report:\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter an extensive sweep of the compound, our agents found many emails on the server. This was the most disturbing:\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? No. I thought not. It\u2019s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\u2019s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026\r\n\r\nHe had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. He could actually save save people from death?\r\n\r\nThe dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. What happened to him?\r\n\r\nHe became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It\u2019s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese revelations are truly sickening, but not surprising. This explains why Schiff was so hell-bent on impeaching our President. It was just a distraction to throw us off the scent of his vile crimes against humanity.\r\n\r\nShare this:", "@kulhuk 7 Twain's is \"The older I get the more I realize how little I know. \"   The one above is Lincoln.  another favourite of mine.", "@Carol Been a rash of those idiots lately!", "@Y B he didnt win the last one in a landslide he ALMOST LOST THE ELECTORAL TO FUCKIN HILLARY CLINTON", "@imark next movie: 'Forrest Trump.", "Twain perhaps. \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4d", "@Y B Troll", "@imark - Trump will win reelection in an epic, mind-boggling landslide.

Doctors are beginning to have to make horrible choices when they have 10 very ill Covid-19 patients and only 3 available ICU beds.  What do you think is going to happen to those other 7 patients?  First infections spiked, then the number of positive cases spiked, now hospitalizations are spiking.   Deaths will follow, with the death numbers increasing rapidly over the next few weeks.  \n\nBy the way, what do you suppose will happen to the heart attack and stroke victims and the regular flow of critically ill patients when all of three ICU beds are full of Covid-19 patients and the doctors and nurses can't be stretched any further?
